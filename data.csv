Regarding the new rules, you can check them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/about/rules/) or in the sidebar. They are pretty simple, but your opinions and questions are welcome.

1,t3_bnhb70,"Hi! Hoping y'all may be able to help me. I'm 25/M and I've never had constipation issues before.  I get anxiety semi-easily so I'm hoping one of you friendly folks can help me ease my worries. &lt;333

Basically, I've only had small pebbles / small pencil-shaped BMs for around 8 or 9 days now. No sizable BMs. I was very dehydrated and eating horribly when this started (an anomaly for me) which almost certainly triggered it, so I've been drinking 3 liters of water and eating much much healthier every day since.

I went to a GI doctor 4 days ago and he told me to take Miralax once daily and to supplement with Metamucil if I want, which I've been doing. It hasn't really helped as far as I can tell. I'm not in pain, just mild discomfort, but I'm a little worried and want to nip this in the bud. Today is day 8, and I took a full dose (30ml) of Milk of Magnesia this morning and it only resulted in a few small bursts of green powdery-looking diarrhea — which I sense may be the Metamucil fiber mixed with the green chlorophyll of all the vegetables I'm eating. Now I've just inserted a glycerin suppository 30 minutes ago but I'm not really feeling anything at all.

I have a check-in with the GI doctor on Monday since he doesn't work weekends. Should I try and see an urgent care doctor before then? Is there something else I should try?",Constipation

10,t3_bknygc,"TL;DR : I'm a programmer and I stopped slouching on my chair at work.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a programmer, I'm at my desk monday to friday. I lift weights 3 times a week for 1.5 hours each time. I drink at least 2 liters of water per day, I drink coffee, I eat veggies and I eat spicy food. I've had pretty bad constipation issues for the past 3.5 years (taking a shit one day per week, often by using senna). I've tried a ton of things, including huge amounts of fiber supplements, fibrous foods and  PEG 3350. Nothing worked for more than two weeks. I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

It's the ONLY thing that changed during that time. I don't know the science that could explain why I don't have issues anymore. The only thing there is is that my lower back stays perpendicular to the ground for a longer period per day than before.",Constipation

To start off I am 17 y/o, and I haven't been a regular pooper for as long as I remember, I just want to share my story today because before it happened I never thought that I'll make it out of this. 

Basically, this may be a little fucked up but I like holding my poo in, I know. I haven't pooped in like 2.5 weeks and things got real bad real quick, I started losing my appetite, I couldn't eat at all and even if I ate, I'd puke it right away. my poo started to leak while the hard bit wouldn't come out. when I realized how bad things got, I started to go to the toilet but, no joy. I'd spend hours in there just to get a little bit of it out, with indescribable pain.

I have tried macrogol 4000, sodium picosulfate, nothing worked at all until this morning, I told my mother to take me to the doctor and I told him all about this, he prescribed docusate sodium, the ones that you administer rectally, and thank god it worked. 

I feel so much better now though I don't think I have defecated completely, I'm planning on going in again tonight to try to fully empty my stomach.

15,t3_bjlduq,"Helppppp please! Basically- I have a huge bowel issue going on for the last 6 months. I literally can barely poop. I'm having a lot of fiber in my diet, I was having small pieces get stuck in my lower rectum weeks to months ago causing immense pain and discomfort when sitting. Since taking more fiber / changing my diet a little bit more I've taken care of a lot of that, but now It seems stuck a little higher up the rectum, about 4 inches in and I have to manually pull it out (as gross as it sounds) in order to relieve some of the pain.

It is also causing me extreme discomfort / lower back pain that  I've never had before.

Also. I'm young, 27, 6'0, 170 lbs, and run / exercise 4+ times a week. 

I've taken  citrucel which just bulks it but still it gets stuck. I had a colonoscopy the dr only found a polyp, 2cm and small hemmroids which he doesn't think is the issue at all.

But at this point the only thing I can do is take laxatives and clean out my whole colon to get everyone to come out regularly.

16,t3_bip1wz,"I began a strict caloric restriction in Sept 2018 and by Jan 2019 had lost around 11kg. When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

Having monitored BM everyday for the past 3 weeks or so, I can see that: for the first week once per 4 day period was typical, but during the past two weeks there was only one day without a BM. Boluses are consistently Bristol 4, minimal discomfort, sense of completion of evacuation is consistently in the 85% + range, and total size is generally large (20 to 30 cm length).

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.  I'm going to try psyllium here soon when I get to the store next but what could possibly be CAUSING this resistance to anything that could soften things up back there?  It's getting to be a little ridiculous, doing everything I can and still tearing open my fissure every.  Damn.  Morning.  Because I can't soften my stools.  


OH and edit:  I went to my PCP's office about a month ago and she seemed completely resistant to any other options for me other than surgery to heal just the fissure and could offer no real suggestions other than referring me to a surgeon.

I recently started a colon cleanse...I know, I know, that's a really bad idea and everything but I needed some relief and the product I'm using was my least-worst option.  It's working but it's also not sustainable and I don't want to be in the same boat in 2 weeks.

50,t3_ayfsfm,"Several minutes after waking up, I felt the need to poop.
After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

51,t3_aydf7f,"Last week I thought I hurt my back which isn’t unusual for me. It finally hurt so bad that Saturday I went to a chiro because that was the only place open and I just wanted to feel better. Found out that I was constipated. So I went and got some magnesium citrate because i had this happen once about 15 years ago and that’s what they recommended. It helped a little bit but I noticed that I still hadn’t gone to the bathroom two days after I used it. 

On Tuesday my mom had to end up taking me to the ER because my back hurt so bad I thought I was gonna die. While waiting on the drs, my sciatic nerves started to hurt. I mean intense pain from my lower back down both legs, all the way to my toes. The drs came back said I was severely constipated still and let me choose between lactulose or what they give people for colonoscopies. I chose the lactulose because I didn’t want to drink 2 gallons of anything. It seemed to work for a little bit. I’m supposed to take 10ml 3 times a day. After my first dose I went and started clearing out well. Back pain was still there but not as bad. I only took one dose that night because it was late when I got home. 

I took my first dose of the day yesterday, but the second dose all together, and went a little more. The sciatic pain was still reeling it’s head. I’m talking can’t take more than 5 steps before I have to sit, feel like my bones are all breaking, kind of pain. Here we are, two days later, I’ve taken one days worth of full doses, and a dose this morning and I still haven’t gone beyond my second dose. And the pain is getting worse. I don’t know what to do. I’m at the point where I would rather die than feel like this.

55,t3_awvsdb,"I haven't had much luck finding anyone else who has this, but it caused me a problem my whole life.

When away from home I don't get the urge to defecate at all.  It's not that I have to go and hold it, I just don't have any urge at all.  I usually go about an hour and a half after eating breakfast.  The problem is that I usually eat and and leave for work about 30 minutes later, meaning I don't get to go all day, and maybe the urge doesn't come at home that evening.  Maybe it lasts another day or two.  It's torture.

Recently, I had a friend visit my house.  While he was here, I didn't get the urge at all.  As soon as I dropped him off at the airport and came home, I got the urge within about 10 minutes.  It doesn't make any sense, but it must be deeply rooted psychologically. People I have talked to don't understand at all, and simply claim that it doesn't make sense because having to go is just a physical response, and if you have to go, you go, whenever or wherever.

I'm amazed at people who defecate in public restrooms. I want to, but don't get the urge away from home.

65,t3_am3srl,"The following are natural remedies for constipation that at first may seem too simple to work, but I’m sure one of these will work for you. 

You will notice a recurring theme here, which is that your bowels are more likely to move first thing in the morning and many of the remedies necessitate you employ them first thing in the morning. 

Feel free to try more than one in the same day, or you can try one at a time. 

1. Drink 1-2 liters of water in a short time span. And then go for a walk. 

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

* I started drinking twice as much water and that absolutely helped.
* I make sure to walk enough each day. 
* I took a laxative in hopes that I could break up any blockages a month ago. That seemed to get things moving.  It was only on one occasion, but it seemed effective.
* Eat less sugar. 
* I also started making my own bread. Nothing fancy, just some homemade wheat bread and white bread. That has made a big difference! I eat bread everyday at breakfast. I'm not sure if its the fiber increase, or maybe eliminating some preservatives  from my diet that are in store-bought bread, but I haven't had an issue since.

It had never gotten too bad because since about 2nd grade I’ve been on adhd medicine which most of them are stimulants so they have helped keep me regular. But recently, I’ve went to the dr for stomach and side pain, which I assumed was either my ovarian cysts or my kidney cyst which I recently gotten diagnosed with, but the doctor said that they shouldn’t really be causing me pain. So I got an ultrasound and they said that I had mild constipation and told me to take a laxative. Instead I just ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a fiber bar and waited, which helped me finally go to the bathroom. I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up?

Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help. Or does senna take most of that away? **I know you guys are not doctors, or a substitute, but I need reassurance it'll be ok, or that there's something else I can do to help myself since all but two doctors have dismissed my issues in my 14 years of visits.**     


&amp;#x200B;

**tldr; severe chronic constipation with exceptional pain, don't know how to cope emotionally/physically or advocate for myself, haven't been given enough information on what I've been dealing with. advice/reassurance I'm not going to die when I finally go to the bathroom so I don't hold it in would be appreciated. Or should I just skip all this and head to the ER? Literally anything would help me out right now.** ",Constipation
96,t3_a4p633,"This is a very personal post but a serious problem, not really sure where else on the internet to post this.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out. I drink a LOT of water daily by the way, at least 6 bottles of 16oz water a day.",Constipation
97,t3_a3w1b1,"It’s been about a week and a half where I haven’t had a good BM. I’ve only been passing small, hard pebbles and straining a lot :( at first I tried prunelax as I thought something gentle would do me good but only pebbles the next day still. Next, I tried Miralax as I thought that was a strong choice but only pebbles still. I’m now on day 2 of miralax but it wasn’t doing anything so I also took a Dulcolax suppository today. This of course stimulated some bowel movement but it was just getting out hard pebbles still! And that’s where I am now, still feeling the effects of Dulcolax but not really pooping much more. Could it be it was just the pebbles that needed to come out? Will the Dulcolax still do more? It’s been 3 hours now and no real BM have occurred. What should I do? Any advice?

Thanks in advance. I’m really bloated and uncomfortable and really not sure how this happened as I usually have a fine pooping schedule. :(",Constipation
98,t3_a3e22n,"Hello all, this is my first post here! I’ve felt constipated for 3 weeks now. I definitely have more than 3 bowel movements a week, and the stool ranges from little rabbit pellets to decent-sized bulky ones. When I wipe, I would usually find some mucus, not a lot. I just feel like I can’t go the way I used to anymore. The bloating is sometimes uncomfortable. Usually,I would eat a banana every morning and that would help with bowel movements a little, but now I’m finding that they’re not working as well as they did a week ago. I took a laxative pill a few days ago and that made me go diarrhea, but I still felt constipated after. A couple days ago, I did take Miralax and that worked pretty well for me the next morning.

99,t3_a39lso,"Over the last couple of months I've noticed some issues ""going"". The very first thing I noticed was the time I would need to go. For many years I could time almost to the minute, 2-3 times per day. Over the last couple of weeks it has been greatly reduced, once per day, sometimes skipping a day, straining to go, etc. I tried Miralax and it seemed to help somewhat. I read an article by a GI doctor and it recommended sesame seeds and psyllium. Both of these have greatly helped, my appetite is better, and I just feel better overall. However, I've noticed that I now seem to have a constant mild-moderate lower back pain, directly in the middle of my back above my tailbone area. I am not entirely sure it is related to my constipation. It is not unbearable, just a nagging dull pain. It seems to go away once I move my bowels, but comes back soon after I eat.

I prefer to try and avoid laxatives because I’m afraid of them making the cramping even more worse and intense. Which is probably stupid of me, I know.

The only reasons why I think this happened was that I was eating a lot if great food that was home cooked, as well as almost walking 7 miles a day around the festival grounds. My husband also felt this. 

Usually when I travel it’s the opposite!!

Is it really as simple as avoiding processed foods and exercising? Or is there something in the water in New Orleans?

 I was also drinking a ton of iced tea and wine which is usually constipating! So I was very confused!

I had a hemmoroidectomy to remove horribly large external ones but internal ones were left untouched due to safety concerns with my surgeon. I also got sick a lot as a kid. 

I used to drink milk constantly. I have now since cut that out mostly and only drink a coffee a day and water. I eat blue berry fiber bars everyday and salad. I've had prune juice, stool softeners, mild laxatives all yielding various to no results. Finally I found super colon cleanse (green bottle) in pill form.  Taking it gave me mad painful stomach cramps and sometimes diaherreha but afterwards I felt so much better. Didn't feel like I had to go the rest of the day. Stopped getting sick, migraines, and other stomach related issues. 

 The bottle says to only take it for 10 days every two months. I tried that and went right back to having a hard time passing anything. So I went back on it. I didn't always take 4 pills a day sometimes only 2 or even none but I went far beyond the 10 days. About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end!

I had X-rays at a medical clinic done a few months ago saying my colon was fine but was very impacted with feces. When I went for this x-ray I was experiencing horrible stomach pain.

If she doesn't poop then she is unable to poop at any other time and sometimes like this last weekend she is unable to poop for multiple days.  


In that past she abused laxatives to the point of where she would have to take multiple servings in order for it to be effective. A while back she stopped taking any laxatives at all.

139,t3_97x6co,"Hey it's me again, I made a post about being constipated some days ago and I wasn't able to pass gas yesterday so I decided to take action today.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out. It continued like a storm and it hurt so fucking bad I could not just stop, the bowel movement was like operating on its own all i could do was control the straining intensity for most part of this traumatic experience. It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax? 
I have my appointment tomorrow so i'll let my GP know but still I'm really shocked/happy but also terrified of this becoming an habit.

I know people here are not health profesionnals but If someone has a similar experience/tips on what to eat ordrink after this I'd really appreciate it.",Constipation

144,t3_949taj,"This is happened to me twice in one year, and I'm wondering if its because I have chronic constipation issues. The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better. The next day I was week and exhausted, but felt way better.

Now I thought maybe this had been caused by food poisoning or something, but I'm now wondering if my body is purging itself after being so constipated for so long. 

Has this happened to anyone else out there? Does your body eventually just say, I need a deep cleaning, and put you through this hell?

148,t3_934n6z,"Today, I went to the ER for severe constipation.  Sounds strange right?  

Here's the story.  I have been overall having some issues with constipation ever since I have been in wellburtin xl (generic) about 3 months ago.  I'm currently on the 300 mg.   This medication has been making me constipated.  I've only really been getting minor issues with it initially so I've been just doing the basics in terms of treating the symptoms.  

This week I have been having hard pebble stools (level 1) on the stool chart starting last Monday.  These defecations were 1 a day but only minor stool was passed.  My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.

**ISSUE:** I get constipation regularly. About half the days in a given month I am constipated. It takes the form of: In ability to pass stool. Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain. Of course this causes stress and a clouded mind/ bad mood whenever I'm like this because who wouldn't be upset when they can't poop?

**TRIED METHODS:**  Smooth move tea ( worked when I was a kid, not anymore) , Miralax, Olive oil ( works on occasion if things are not too stuck up), Metamucil, changing diet and exercise ( and sticking to it), Increasing liquid intake, increasing fiber from diet, v8, juices, dried fruits, stretching, self massage ( only works if stomach is not tight from pain or distention which it is tight 9/10 times) , PT for corrective breathing/pushing.

**COLONOSCOPY:** Came back 100&amp;#37; clean.

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon.

I tried DGL and after two days I started to notice some sensation had returned, the movements were a bit stronger, and more was coming. As the days went on, the urge to go became stronger. Before I was really ""listening"" for the slightest indication I needed to go, but after starting DGL I began to notice I had strong enough urges that I had to drop whatever I was doing and go to the rest room.
Now I'm feeling pretty good, maybe 90%, enough to say I feel pretty much back to normal.

Just wanted to put this out there for others to try.

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

This is the DGL I use, I take one in the morning on an empty stomatch with water, coffee an hour later. I usually fast in the morning, I only drink straight coffee, nothing added. Licorice interferes with blood clotting drugs, make sure to read about other contraindications.

Naturally I spent a lot of time reading about constipation and trying different home remedies. Here's what I've settled on.

(1) Drink coffee before eating breakfast. I never used to drink coffee but I gave it a try and it seems to help.

(2) Gradually increased the amount of fiber I eat. Most fruits and vegetables don't contain enough fiber to make it worth eating them. Seriously, look up the number of grams of fiber per 100 grams of apple or celery; it's not worth the trouble of chewing them and swallowing them!

Split peas and lentils, which are very easy to cook, contain a worthwhile amount of fiber. And chia seeds, of course. A tablespoon of chia seeds in 4 tablespoons of warm water forms a disgusting glop that is chock full of healthy fiber.

(3) Take a magnesium supplement. Some days I take magnesium citrate capsules, other days I dissolve half a teaspoon of epsom salt (which is magnesium sulfate) in water and chug it down.

(4) I reduced my consumption of bananas, cheese, and calcium-based antacids (Tums). I read that they have a ""binding"" effect on some people.

I am a 19 year old female. 
I have been constipated since the 31st of December. It was a Saturday night. The last thing I ate that night was a takeaway pizza. Now, usually after eating pizza I get diarrhoea, so I was curious the next morning when I realised the food didn't exit my body. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, I bought Ducolax laxatives and they worked their magic on my bowels within 4 hours. I took another pill on Thursday as I had ate a lot of food that week and my bowels didn't seem to be working on their own. The pill didn't work. I took another laxative on Friday which didn't work also. 

I bought Milk of Magnesia, which is magnesium hydroxide, and it worked on the Saturday of that week. I drank 6 5 ml cups of the milk last night and I've had diarrhoea 4 times since then. Diarrhoea is a side effect of the milk. I examined my stool and it was paper thin and had ragged edges, does that make sense? It looked like pieces of ripped toilet paper. 
I have been smelling a foul odor in my mouth, but I brush my teeth many times a day and I am drinking lots of water. I think it is the food rotting inside my body. 
Does anyone have any suggestions for what could be wrong?

Have you ever experienced difficulty in passing your bowels? Almost everyone goes through this at some point in their lives. Being constipated is not a very serious issue but it can be discomforting if it happens often.

When a person has bowel movements less than three times a week or if you have pain or strain while passing your daily motion, you could be suffering from constipation.

While there are no “right” number of times you out to move your bowels, medical experts say it you should pass motion at least once a day.

The most common symptoms of constipation are:

You suffer from bloating or abdominal cramps
Movement of bowels requires a lot of strain
Hard or small stools
You have to depend on laxatives or special food such as yogurt, cereals packed with fiber or oatmeal, juices etcetera
Constipation is usually caused by a number of factors, some of them are:

Low water intake
Lack of fibrous food in the diet
Lack of physical exercise
Over dose of laxatives
There are many ways to avoid constipation in both adults and kids. Here, we list out a few home remedies for constipation or certain treatments that you can perform by yourself to help cure constipation.

Include high fibre food in your diet.
Fibrous food prevents your stools from becoming hard. They help in adding bulk in your motion. When you start adding fibrous food in your diet, ensure you do so little by little as your digestive system will need to get used to it. Some examples of fibrous food are split peas, lentils, black beans, avocado, bran flakes, whole wheat pasta, pearled barley, oatmeal.
Increase water intake.
One well known method to prevent constipation is to liquid forms of food such as soups and juices in one’s diet. Movement of bowels is easier as the stool becomes bulky and softer because of the increased fluid in the colon. Medical experts recommend an adult drinks 2 liters of water a day.
Regular physical exercise.
Doctors recommend that individuals exercise at least 30 minutes every day. Regular exercise enhances blood flow and keeps the various organs active thereby improving digestion.
Keeping these tips in mind, you can prevent constipation. There are many supplements that will help you add fibre into your diet.

I've tried a ton of things, including huge amounts of fiber supplements, fibrous foods and  PEG 3350. Nothing worked for more than two weeks. I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

Also. I'm young, 27, 6'0, 170 lbs, and run / exercise 4+ times a week. 

I've taken  citrucel which just bulks it but still it gets stuck. I had a colonoscopy the dr only found a polyp, 2cm and small hemmroids which he doesn't think is the issue at all.

But at this point the only thing I can do is take laxatives and clean out my whole colon to get everyone to come out regularly.

ANY advice helps. TIA. This sucks. Lol.",Constipation
249,t3_bip1wz,"I began a strict caloric restriction in Sept 2018 and by Jan 2019 had lost around 11kg. When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

Having monitored BM everyday for the past 3 weeks or so, I can see that: for the first week once per 4 day period was typical, but during the past two weeks there was only one day without a BM. Boluses are consistently Bristol 4, minimal discomfort, sense of completion of evacuation is consistently in the 85% + range, and total size is generally large (20 to 30 cm length).

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.  I'm going to try psyllium here soon when I get to the store next but what could possibly be CAUSING this resistance to anything that could soften things up back there?  It's getting to be a little ridiculous, doing everything I can and still tearing open my fissure every.  Damn.  Morning.  Because I can't soften my stools.  


OH and edit:  I went to my PCP's office about a month ago and she seemed completely resistant to any other options for me other than surgery to heal just the fissure and could offer no real suggestions other than referring me to a surgeon.

After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

Every time I poop I am constipated and even after spending a while there i can get a lot out but not all. It's as though my poop is just sitting there at the end of my intestine and not able to all go out. Main issue of this being that my bottom is a poop crayon. Meaning after I poop and between poops if i wipe it is poop on the wipe. I have wasted a visit to the doctor who told me it is just constipation and i should take a laxative but it just persists. Sometimes laxatives just get one out of me or i have to take more than one dose and it just rids me of anything. I exercise every day and eat healthy. Have you any advice or experience over this?,Constipation

I decided to do it anyway and lo and behold when I was on the toilet someone was slamming on the door saying they needed to get in to take a shower.  I got hella anxiety and even after they got out I still couldn’t go because I was still so anxious.  I can tell I’m still so blocked up and I didn’t get everything out.

297,t3_anf0we,"So I'll get constipated every now and then, nothing out of the ordinary, it happens.  But the past few times, it's been incredibly rough.  I'll have the normal pains that come and go every thirty seconds and leave you in a cold sweat, but the pain has gotten so bad, it's led to worse problems.  A few times back, I remember leaning back in pain and the next thing I knew I was leaned over my bathtub with a bump on my head (had passed out and fallen into it since it's right next to the toilet).  This happened another time as well, which is really scary to think I could smack myself and get a concussion on accident.


But last time, there was another layer added.  And this could have just been a virus or something, but I was having problems, had fallen into the tub once (thankfully I didn't hit myself hard), and kept going in and out of consciousness.  At one point, I finally came to and found I had thrown up all over the little rug in front of me.

298,t3_am3srl,"The following are natural remedies for constipation that at first may seem too simple to work, but I’m sure one of these will work for you. 

You will notice a recurring theme here, which is that your bowels are more likely to move first thing in the morning and many of the remedies necessitate you employ them first thing in the morning. 

Feel free to try more than one in the same day, or you can try one at a time. 

1. Drink 1-2 liters of water in a short time span. And then go for a walk. 

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

* I started drinking twice as much water and that absolutely helped.
* I make sure to walk enough each day. 
* I took a laxative in hopes that I could break up any blockages a month ago. That seemed to get things moving.  It was only on one occasion, but it seemed effective.
* Eat less sugar. 
* I also started making my own bread. Nothing fancy, just some homemade wheat bread and white bread. That has made a big difference! I eat bread everyday at breakfast. I'm not sure if its the fiber increase, or maybe eliminating some preservatives  from my diet that are in store-bought bread, but I haven't had an issue since.

It had never gotten too bad because since about 2nd grade I’ve been on adhd medicine which most of them are stimulants so they have helped keep me regular. But recently, I’ve went to the dr for stomach and side pain, which I assumed was either my ovarian cysts or my kidney cyst which I recently gotten diagnosed with, but the doctor said that they shouldn’t really be causing me pain. So I got an ultrasound and they said that I had mild constipation and told me to take a laxative. Instead I just ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a fiber bar and waited, which helped me finally go to the bathroom. I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up?

&amp;#x200B;

  
Since I was 6, I've had issues with constipation; I cannot remember a time in my life where I have not had to worry about it. Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help. Or does senna take most of that away? **I know you guys are not doctors, or a substitute, but I need reassurance it'll be ok, or that there's something else I can do to help myself since all but two doctors have dismissed my issues in my 14 years of visits.**     


&amp;#x200B;

**tldr; severe chronic constipation with exceptional pain, don't know how to cope emotionally/physically or advocate for myself, haven't been given enough information on what I've been dealing with. advice/reassurance I'm not going to die when I finally go to the bathroom so I don't hold it in would be appreciated. Or should I just skip all this and head to the ER? Literally anything would help me out right now.** ",Constipation
329,t3_a4p633,"This is a very personal post but a serious problem, not really sure where else on the internet to post this.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out.

I had a hemmoroidectomy to remove horribly large external ones but internal ones were left untouched due to safety concerns with my surgeon. I also got sick a lot as a kid. 

I used to drink milk constantly. I have now since cut that out mostly and only drink a coffee a day and water. I eat blue berry fiber bars everyday and salad. I've had prune juice, stool softeners, mild laxatives all yielding various to no results. Finally I found super colon cleanse (green bottle) in pill form.  Taking it gave me mad painful stomach cramps and sometimes diaherreha but afterwards I felt so much better. Didn't feel like I had to go the rest of the day. Stopped getting sick, migraines, and other stomach related issues. 

 The bottle says to only take it for 10 days every two months. I tried that and went right back to having a hard time passing anything. So I went back on it. I didn't always take 4 pills a day sometimes only 2 or even none but I went far beyond the 10 days. About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end! I tried the regular colon cleanse (red bottle) by the same company which is just phsylium husk and other stuff but it's not making much of a difference. 

I had X-rays at a medical clinic done a few months ago saying my colon was fine but was very impacted with feces. When I went for this x-ray I was experiencing horrible stomach pain. The super colon cleanse made that pass in combination with quitting milk. However as I stated I am afraid to take that stuff long term and risk damage though I wonder if the damage from a full colon is even worse.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out. It continued like a storm and it hurt so fucking bad I could not just stop, the bowel movement was like operating on its own all i could do was control the straining intensity for most part of this traumatic experience. It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax? 
I have my appointment tomorrow so i'll let my GP know but still I'm really shocked/happy but also terrified of this becoming an habit.

The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better. The next day I was week and exhausted, but felt way better.

Now I thought maybe this had been caused by food poisoning or something, but I'm now wondering if my body is purging itself after being so constipated for so long. 

Has this happened to anyone else out there? Does your body eventually just say, I need a deep cleaning, and put you through this hell? I'm terrified of it happening again, because I am so blocked up again. I've tried probiotics, fiber, laxatives, enemas and everything else, and nothing keeps me regular at all.

381,t3_934n6z,"Today, I went to the ER for severe constipation.  Sounds strange right?  

Here's the story.  I have been overall having some issues with constipation ever since I have been in wellburtin xl (generic) about 3 months ago.  I'm currently on the 300 mg.   This medication has been making me constipated.  I've only really been getting minor issues with it initially so I've been just doing the basics in terms of treating the symptoms.  

This week I have been having hard pebble stools (level 1) on the stool chart starting last Monday.  These defecations were 1 a day but only minor stool was passed.  My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.

**ISSUE:** I get constipation regularly. About half the days in a given month I am constipated. It takes the form of: In ability to pass stool. Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain. Of course this causes stress and a clouded mind/ bad mood whenever I'm like this because who wouldn't be upset when they can't poop? I get pain in the TOP of my stomach, the ascending colon (look down front right part of abdominal area above the pelvis.), and my right side.   

**TYPICAL PERIOD OF CONSTIPATION:**  Anywhere from 7-14 days. ( if it becomes the longer I end up eating soft foods and/or having little hunger.)

**TRIED METHODS:**  Smooth move tea ( worked when I was a kid, not anymore) , Miralax, Olive oil ( works on occasion if things are not too stuck up), Metamucil, changing diet and exercise ( and sticking to it), Increasing liquid intake, increasing fiber from diet, v8, juices, dried fruits, stretching, self massage ( only works if stomach is not tight from pain or distention which it is tight 9/10 times) , PT for corrective breathing/pushing. GI given trial of linzess.

**COLONOSCOPY:** Came back 100&amp;#37; clean. 

**SEEN GI:**  Report told me I suffer from IBS -C ( aka they don't have a root cause) , and he is worried I may develop colon cancer in 10 years from the chronic stress on my colon ( also some adjacent family history of colon cancer.

Doctors do not seem to think it is an issue that I have to use natural laxative agents to go - if I do not take these I can go up to 2 weeks without having a single bowel movement. I have tried so many things, I am at a loss - I increase my fibre, and it seems to make my constipation even worse. I take probiotics and magnesium supplements. Literally, the only thing that seems to work is stimulant laxatives (I always take natural ones, but I know long-term use of senna is not good either and can create dependency).

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon. This could very well be the case, but then do I not have any other choice but to take stimulant laxatives for relief?

Does anyone know if constipation could be a sign of specific types of allergies? I want to request allergy testing from my doctor, but wnat to know what I am asking for. I know I will ask for dairy allergy testing, and perhaps gluten as well.

I tried DGL and after two days I started to notice some sensation had returned, the movements were a bit stronger, and more was coming. As the days went on, the urge to go became stronger. Before I was really ""listening"" for the slightest indication I needed to go, but after starting DGL I began to notice I had strong enough urges that I had to drop whatever I was doing and go to the rest room.
Now I'm feeling pretty good, maybe 90%, enough to say I feel pretty much back to normal.

Just wanted to put this out there for others to try.

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

This is the DGL I use, I take one in the morning on an empty stomatch with water, coffee an hour later. I usually fast in the morning, I only drink straight coffee, nothing added. Licorice interferes with blood clotting drugs, make sure to read about other contraindications.

ive been on a elimination diet for almost 3 weeks now and there was like 3 days where i was having normal movements but now im back to the the constipation! so now im not even sure if it was a food sensitivity. I got some blood work- vitamin d levels- 34 ng/mL (im really low) but im taking 1000ui of d3 a day now. my thyroid-FT4- 1.0 ng/dL, TSH- 0.36 mIU/L (i was told im low)

So i dont know what to do or what it could be! Should i lower my fiber?? is it have to do w/ my low thyroid or vitamin d? The 3 days where i had some nice poops i had a bunch of broccoli and spinach so i began to think maybe i need a magnesium supplement! but i continued eating a bunch of the broccoli and spinach to no avail :( ",Constipation

443,t3_5vvryq,"A year ago my guts slowed down, don't know why, but I was only pooping once every 5 or 6 days. The turds were hard as rocks, the diameter was large, and it took 20 or 30 minutes to get them out of me.

Naturally I spent a lot of time reading about constipation and trying different home remedies. Here's what I've settled on.

(1) Drink coffee before eating breakfast. I never used to drink coffee but I gave it a try and it seems to help.

(2) Gradually increased the amount of fiber I eat. Most fruits and vegetables don't contain enough fiber to make it worth eating them. Seriously, look up the number of grams of fiber per 100 grams of apple or celery; it's not worth the trouble of chewing them and swallowing them!

Split peas and lentils, which are very easy to cook, contain a worthwhile amount of fiber. And chia seeds, of course. A tablespoon of chia seeds in 4 tablespoons of warm water forms a disgusting glop that is chock full of healthy fiber.

(3) Take a magnesium supplement. Some days I take magnesium citrate capsules, other days I dissolve half a teaspoon of epsom salt (which is magnesium sulfate) in water and chug it down.

(4) I reduced my consumption of bananas, cheese, and calcium-based antacids (Tums). I read that they have a ""binding"" effect on some people.

446,t3_5nmxg6,"Hello, 
I am a 19 year old female. 
I have been constipated since the 31st of December. It was a Saturday night. The last thing I ate that night was a takeaway pizza. Now, usually after eating pizza I get diarrhoea, so I was curious the next morning when I realised the food didn't exit my body. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, I bought Ducolax laxatives and they worked their magic on my bowels within 4 hours. I took another pill on Thursday as I had ate a lot of food that week and my bowels didn't seem to be working on their own. The pill didn't work. I took another laxative on Friday which didn't work also. 

I bought Milk of Magnesia, which is magnesium hydroxide, and it worked on the Saturday of that week. I drank 6 5 ml cups of the milk last night and I've had diarrhoea 4 times since then. Diarrhoea is a side effect of the milk. I examined my stool and it was paper thin and had ragged edges, does that make sense? It looked like pieces of ripped toilet paper. 
I have been smelling a foul odor in my mouth, but I brush my teeth many times a day and I am drinking lots of water. I think it is the food rotting inside my body. 
Does anyone have any suggestions for what could be wrong?

Have you ever experienced difficulty in passing your bowels? Almost everyone goes through this at some point in their lives. Being constipated is not a very serious issue but it can be discomforting if it happens often.

When a person has bowel movements less than three times a week or if you have pain or strain while passing your daily motion, you could be suffering from constipation.

While there are no “right” number of times you out to move your bowels, medical experts say it you should pass motion at least once a day.

The most common symptoms of constipation are:

You suffer from bloating or abdominal cramps
Movement of bowels requires a lot of strain
Hard or small stools
You have to depend on laxatives or special food such as yogurt, cereals packed with fiber or oatmeal, juices etcetera
Constipation is usually caused by a number of factors, some of them are:

Low water intake
Lack of fibrous food in the diet
Lack of physical exercise
Over dose of laxatives
There are many ways to avoid constipation in both adults and kids. Here, we list out a few home remedies for constipation or certain treatments that you can perform by yourself to help cure constipation.

Include high fibre food in your diet.
Fibrous food prevents your stools from becoming hard. They help in adding bulk in your motion. When you start adding fibrous food in your diet, ensure you do so little by little as your digestive system will need to get used to it. Some examples of fibrous food are split peas, lentils, black beans, avocado, bran flakes, whole wheat pasta, pearled barley, oatmeal.
Increase water intake.
One well known method to prevent constipation is to liquid forms of food such as soups and juices in one’s diet. Movement of bowels is easier as the stool becomes bulky and softer because of the increased fluid in the colon. Medical experts recommend an adult drinks 2 liters of water a day.
Regular physical exercise.
Doctors recommend that individuals exercise at least 30 minutes every day. Regular exercise enhances blood flow and keeps the various organs active thereby improving digestion.
Keeping these tips in mind, you can prevent constipation. There are many supplements that will help you add fibre into your diet.

Basically, I've only had small pebbles / small pencil-shaped BMs for around 8 or 9 days now. No sizable BMs. I was very dehydrated and eating horribly when this started (an anomaly for me) which almost certainly triggered it, so I've been drinking 3 liters of water and eating much much healthier every day since.

I went to a GI doctor 4 days ago and he told me to take Miralax once daily and to supplement with Metamucil if I want, which I've been doing. It hasn't really helped as far as I can tell. I'm not in pain, just mild discomfort, but I'm a little worried and want to nip this in the bud. Today is day 8, and I took a full dose (30ml) of Milk of Magnesia this morning and it only resulted in a few small bursts of green powdery-looking diarrhea — which I sense may be the Metamucil fiber mixed with the green chlorophyll of all the vegetables I'm eating. Now I've just inserted a glycerin suppository 30 minutes ago but I'm not really feeling anything at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a programmer, I'm at my desk monday to friday. I lift weights 3 times a week for 1.5 hours each time. I drink at least 2 liters of water per day, I drink coffee, I eat veggies and I eat spicy food. I've had pretty bad constipation issues for the past 3.5 years (taking a shit one day per week, often by using senna). I've tried a ton of things, including huge amounts of fiber supplements, fibrous foods and  PEG 3350. Nothing worked for more than two weeks. I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

It's the ONLY thing that changed during that time. I don't know the science that could explain why I don't have issues anymore. The only thing there is is that my lower back stays perpendicular to the ground for a longer period per day than before.",Constipation

482,t3_bip1wz,"I began a strict caloric restriction in Sept 2018 and by Jan 2019 had lost around 11kg. When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

Having monitored BM everyday for the past 3 weeks or so, I can see that: for the first week once per 4 day period was typical, but during the past two weeks there was only one day without a BM.

503,t3_b6s95d,"Enjoy my throwaway username lol

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.  I'm going to try psyllium here soon when I get to the store next but what could possibly be CAUSING this resistance to anything that could soften things up back there?  It's getting to be a little ridiculous, doing everything I can and still tearing open my fissure every.  Damn.  Morning.  Because I can't soften my stools.  


OH and edit:  I went to my PCP's office about a month ago and she seemed completely resistant to any other options for me other than surgery to heal just the fissure and could offer no real suggestions other than referring me to a surgeon.  This is something I am going to avoid as long as possible because I'm certain the reason I'm not healing is because my ass just refuses to pass anything but rock hard lumps.

516,t3_ayfsfm,"Several minutes after waking up, I felt the need to poop.
After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

It helped a little bit but I noticed that I still hadn’t gone to the bathroom two days after I used it. 

On Tuesday my mom had to end up taking me to the ER because my back hurt so bad I thought I was gonna die. While waiting on the drs, my sciatic nerves started to hurt. I mean intense pain from my lower back down both legs, all the way to my toes. The drs came back said I was severely constipated still and let me choose between lactulose or what they give people for colonoscopies. I chose the lactulose because I didn’t want to drink 2 gallons of anything. It seemed to work for a little bit. I’m supposed to take 10ml 3 times a day. After my first dose I went and started clearing out well. Back pain was still there but not as bad. I only took one dose that night because it was late when I got home. 

I took my first dose of the day yesterday, but the second dose all together, and went a little more. The sciatic pain was still reeling it’s head. I’m talking can’t take more than 5 steps before I have to sit, feel like my bones are all breaking, kind of pain.

531,t3_am3srl,"The following are natural remedies for constipation that at first may seem too simple to work, but I’m sure one of these will work for you. 

You will notice a recurring theme here, which is that your bowels are more likely to move first thing in the morning and many of the remedies necessitate you employ them first thing in the morning. 

Feel free to try more than one in the same day, or you can try one at a time. 

1. Drink 1-2 liters of water in a short time span. And then go for a walk. 

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

I realized that even though its whole wheat with fiber, the bread ITSELF was the one causing the majority of my chronic constipation. I stopped intaking bread.. or at least limiting it substantially to the point where after 4 to 5 months I've been mainly constipated free with normal bowel movements. Occasional constipation, but I've managed to be able to go daily. I can even ingest a lot of cheese now crazy enough.

557,t3_a8vvm9,"Soo I’m 15 years old and for as long as I can remember I’ve had trouble with constipation. It had never gotten too bad because since about 2nd grade I’ve been on adhd medicine which most of them are stimulants so they have helped keep me regular. But recently, I’ve went to the dr for stomach and side pain, which I assumed was either my ovarian cysts or my kidney cyst which I recently gotten diagnosed with, but the doctor said that they shouldn’t really be causing me pain. So I got an ultrasound and they said that I had mild constipation and told me to take a laxative. Instead I just ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a fiber bar and waited, which helped me finally go to the bathroom. I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up? Anyways I’m going to the bathroom everyday again but only with my adhd medicine and I still don’t go as much as I usually do, I’m trying to incorporate fiber bars into my diet and just improve my diet overall because it’s not the best.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Since I was 6, I've had issues with constipation; I cannot remember a time in my life where I have not had to worry about it. Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help. Or does senna take most of that away? **I know you guys are not doctors, or a substitute, but I need reassurance it'll be ok, or that there's something else I can do to help myself since all but two doctors have dismissed my issues in my 14 years of visits.**     


&amp;#x200B;

**tldr; severe chronic constipation with exceptional pain, don't know how to cope emotionally/physically or advocate for myself, haven't been given enough information on what I've been dealing with. advice/reassurance I'm not going to die when I finally go to the bathroom so I don't hold it in would be appreciated. Or should I just skip all this and head to the ER? Literally anything would help me out right now.** ",Constipation
562,t3_a4p633,"This is a very personal post but a serious problem, not really sure where else on the internet to post this.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out. I drink a LOT of water daily by the way, at least 6 bottles of 16oz water a day.",Constipation

1. Drink 2-3 table spoons of vegetable oil twice daily.
2. Do this over about 3 days.

I know it's terrible tasting, but it did wonders for me. Completely, unclogged my pipes, and  back on track without taking anything (no prune juice, laxatives Etc...).

594,t3_9istch,"I'll try to make this as brief as possible. Dealt with hard stools my entire life. Didn't think much of it until I developed hemmoroids in my early 20s to present day at 28. I had a hemmoroidectomy to remove horribly large external ones but internal ones were left untouched due to safety concerns with my surgeon. I also got sick a lot as a kid. 

I used to drink milk constantly. I have now since cut that out mostly and only drink a coffee a day and water. I eat blue berry fiber bars everyday and salad. I've had prune juice, stool softeners, mild laxatives all yielding various to no results. Finally I found super colon cleanse (green bottle) in pill form.  Taking it gave me mad painful stomach cramps and sometimes diaherreha but afterwards I felt so much better. Didn't feel like I had to go the rest of the day. Stopped getting sick, migraines, and other stomach related issues. 

 The bottle says to only take it for 10 days every two months. I tried that and went right back to having a hard time passing anything. So I went back on it. I didn't always take 4 pills a day sometimes only 2 or even none but I went far beyond the 10 days. About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end! I tried the regular colon cleanse (red bottle) by the same company which is just phsylium husk and other stuff but it's not making much of a difference. 

I had X-rays at a medical clinic done a few months ago saying my colon was fine but was very impacted with feces. When I went for this x-ray I was experiencing horrible stomach pain. The super colon cleanse made that pass in combination with quitting milk. However as I stated I am afraid to take that stuff long term and risk damage though I wonder if the damage from a full colon is even worse.

I began taking fiber to force this shit out, and it worked - although not in satisfactory amounts. 

This has now been my life for the last few months, forcing incomplete bowel movements with fucking fiber. I have an appointment with a gastro doc next month if I make it till then - but I have a hunch I'll need to see a colo-rectal.

605,t3_97x6co,"Hey it's me again, I made a post about being constipated some days ago and I wasn't able to pass gas yesterday so I decided to take action today.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out. It continued like a storm and it hurt so fucking bad I could not just stop, the bowel movement was like operating on its own all i could do was control the straining intensity for most part of this traumatic experience. It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax? 
I have my appointment tomorrow so i'll let my GP know but still I'm really shocked/happy but also terrified of this becoming an habit.

The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better. The next day I was week and exhausted, but felt way better.

Now I thought maybe this had been caused by food poisoning or something, but I'm now wondering if my body is purging itself after being so constipated for so long.

Here's the story.  I have been overall having some issues with constipation ever since I have been in wellburtin xl (generic) about 3 months ago.  I'm currently on the 300 mg.   This medication has been making me constipated.  I've only really been getting minor issues with it initially so I've been just doing the basics in terms of treating the symptoms.  

This week I have been having hard pebble stools (level 1) on the stool chart starting last Monday.  These defecations were 1 a day but only minor stool was passed.  My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.

631,t3_8tgg2k,"I’ll preface and say I’m 27 years old and have had minor constipation issues much of my life and then around 12-13 is when it really started to get bad. I was diagnosed with ibs at 16. After I got into a car accident a few years ago my symptoms have been worse than ever. But I have been able to somewhat manage my symptoms with miralax and zofran.


Anyway. I knew I was constipated because when it gets this bad, I can hardly eat, barely have an appetite, and have stabbing pains in my abdomen with lower back pain that comes and goes. I still poop, but have trouble emptying myself out, which is a fairly normal issue in my life. I’ve been drinking miralax every night and trying to get myself to pass some stuff.

**ISSUE:** I get constipation regularly. About half the days in a given month I am constipated. It takes the form of: In ability to pass stool. Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain. Of course this causes stress and a clouded mind/ bad mood whenever I'm like this because who wouldn't be upset when they can't poop? I get pain in the TOP of my stomach, the ascending colon (look down front right part of abdominal area above the pelvis.), and my right side.   

**TYPICAL PERIOD OF CONSTIPATION:**  Anywhere from 7-14 days. ( if it becomes the longer I end up eating soft foods and/or having little hunger.)

**TRIED METHODS:**  Smooth move tea ( worked when I was a kid, not anymore) , Miralax, Olive oil ( works on occasion if things are not too stuck up), Metamucil, changing diet and exercise ( and sticking to it), Increasing liquid intake, increasing fiber from diet, v8, juices, dried fruits, stretching, self massage ( only works if stomach is not tight from pain or distention which it is tight 9/10 times) , PT for corrective breathing/pushing. GI given trial of linzess.

**COLONOSCOPY:** Came back 100&amp;#37; clean. 

**SEEN GI:**  Report told me I suffer from IBS -C ( aka they don't have a root cause) , and he is worried I may develop colon cancer in 10 years from the chronic stress on my colon ( also some adjacent family history of colon cancer.

People. If I'm honest with myself sometimes I think whether life like this is livable. It effects my life in so many ways: mood, outlook on life, whether I go to social events, what I eat, how I sleep ( I get little sleep , I think it's because my body understands something is wrong), basically my stomach determines my life.

Doctors do not seem to think it is an issue that I have to use natural laxative agents to go - if I do not take these I can go up to 2 weeks without having a single bowel movement. I have tried so many things, I am at a loss - I increase my fibre, and it seems to make my constipation even worse. I take probiotics and magnesium supplements. Literally, the only thing that seems to work is stimulant laxatives (I always take natural ones, but I know long-term use of senna is not good either and can create dependency).

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon. This could very well be the case, but then do I not have any other choice but to take stimulant laxatives for relief?

Does anyone know if constipation could be a sign of specific types of allergies? I want to request allergy testing from my doctor, but wnat to know what I am asking for. I know I will ask for dairy allergy testing, and perhaps gluten as well.

I tried DGL and after two days I started to notice some sensation had returned, the movements were a bit stronger, and more was coming. As the days went on, the urge to go became stronger. Before I was really ""listening"" for the slightest indication I needed to go, but after starting DGL I began to notice I had strong enough urges that I had to drop whatever I was doing and go to the rest room.
Now I'm feeling pretty good, maybe 90%, enough to say I feel pretty much back to normal.

Just wanted to put this out there for others to try.

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

This is the DGL I use, I take one in the morning on an empty stomatch with water, coffee an hour later. I usually fast in the morning, I only drink straight coffee, nothing added. Licorice interferes with blood clotting drugs, make sure to read about other contraindications.

Naturally I spent a lot of time reading about constipation and trying different home remedies. Here's what I've settled on.

(1) Drink coffee before eating breakfast. I never used to drink coffee but I gave it a try and it seems to help.

(2) Gradually increased the amount of fiber I eat. Most fruits and vegetables don't contain enough fiber to make it worth eating them. Seriously, look up the number of grams of fiber per 100 grams of apple or celery; it's not worth the trouble of chewing them and swallowing them!

Split peas and lentils, which are very easy to cook, contain a worthwhile amount of fiber. And chia seeds, of course. A tablespoon of chia seeds in 4 tablespoons of warm water forms a disgusting glop that is chock full of healthy fiber.

(3) Take a magnesium supplement. Some days I take magnesium citrate capsules, other days I dissolve half a teaspoon of epsom salt (which is magnesium sulfate) in water and chug it down.

(4) I reduced my consumption of bananas, cheese, and calcium-based antacids (Tums). I read that they have a ""binding"" effect on some people.

I am a 19 year old female. 
I have been constipated since the 31st of December. It was a Saturday night. The last thing I ate that night was a takeaway pizza. Now, usually after eating pizza I get diarrhoea, so I was curious the next morning when I realised the food didn't exit my body. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, I bought Ducolax laxatives and they worked their magic on my bowels within 4 hours. I took another pill on Thursday as I had ate a lot of food that week and my bowels didn't seem to be working on their own. The pill didn't work. I took another laxative on Friday which didn't work also. 

I bought Milk of Magnesia, which is magnesium hydroxide, and it worked on the Saturday of that week. I drank 6 5 ml cups of the milk last night and I've had diarrhoea 4 times since then. Diarrhoea is a side effect of the milk. I examined my stool and it was paper thin and had ragged edges, does that make sense? It looked like pieces of ripped toilet paper. 
I have been smelling a foul odor in my mouth, but I brush my teeth many times a day and I am drinking lots of water. I think it is the food rotting inside my body.

Have you ever experienced difficulty in passing your bowels? Almost everyone goes through this at some point in their lives. Being constipated is not a very serious issue but it can be discomforting if it happens often.

When a person has bowel movements less than three times a week or if you have pain or strain while passing your daily motion, you could be suffering from constipation.

While there are no “right” number of times you out to move your bowels, medical experts say it you should pass motion at least once a day.

The most common symptoms of constipation are:

You suffer from bloating or abdominal cramps
Movement of bowels requires a lot of strain
Hard or small stools
You have to depend on laxatives or special food such as yogurt, cereals packed with fiber or oatmeal, juices etcetera
Constipation is usually caused by a number of factors, some of them are:

Low water intake
Lack of fibrous food in the diet
Lack of physical exercise
Over dose of laxatives
There are many ways to avoid constipation in both adults and kids. Here, we list out a few home remedies for constipation or certain treatments that you can perform by yourself to help cure constipation.

Include high fibre food in your diet.
Fibrous food prevents your stools from becoming hard. They help in adding bulk in your motion. When you start adding fibrous food in your diet, ensure you do so little by little as your digestive system will need to get used to it. Some examples of fibrous food are split peas, lentils, black beans, avocado, bran flakes, whole wheat pasta, pearled barley, oatmeal.
Increase water intake.
One well known method to prevent constipation is to liquid forms of food such as soups and juices in one’s diet. Movement of bowels is easier as the stool becomes bulky and softer because of the increased fluid in the colon. Medical experts recommend an adult drinks 2 liters of water a day.

Basically, I've only had small pebbles / small pencil-shaped BMs for around 8 or 9 days now. No sizable BMs. I was very dehydrated and eating horribly when this started (an anomaly for me) which almost certainly triggered it, so I've been drinking 3 liters of water and eating much much healthier every day since.

I went to a GI doctor 4 days ago and he told me to take Miralax once daily and to supplement with Metamucil if I want, which I've been doing. It hasn't really helped as far as I can tell. I'm not in pain, just mild discomfort, but I'm a little worried and want to nip this in the bud. Today is day 8, and I took a full dose (30ml) of Milk of Magnesia this morning and it only resulted in a few small bursts of green powdery-looking diarrhea — which I sense may be the Metamucil fiber mixed with the green chlorophyll of all the vegetables I'm eating. Now I've just inserted a glycerin suppository 30 minutes ago but I'm not really feeling anything at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a programmer, I'm at my desk monday to friday. I lift weights 3 times a week for 1.5 hours each time. I drink at least 2 liters of water per day, I drink coffee, I eat veggies and I eat spicy food. I've had pretty bad constipation issues for the past 3.5 years (taking a shit one day per week, often by using senna). I've tried a ton of things, including huge amounts of fiber supplements, fibrous foods and  PEG 3350. Nothing worked for more than two weeks. I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

It's the ONLY thing that changed during that time. I don't know the science that could explain why I don't have issues anymore. The only thing there is is that my lower back stays perpendicular to the ground for a longer period per day than before.",Constipation

I haven't pooped in like 2.5 weeks and things got real bad real quick, I started losing my appetite, I couldn't eat at all and even if I ate, I'd puke it right away. my poo started to leak while the hard bit wouldn't come out. when I realized how bad things got, I started to go to the toilet but, no joy. I'd spend hours in there just to get a little bit of it out, with indescribable pain.

I have tried macrogol 4000, sodium picosulfate, nothing worked at all until this morning, I told my mother to take me to the doctor and I told him all about this, he prescribed docusate sodium, the ones that you administer rectally, and thank god it worked.

Since taking more fiber / changing my diet a little bit more I've taken care of a lot of that, but now It seems stuck a little higher up the rectum, about 4 inches in and I have to manually pull it out (as gross as it sounds) in order to relieve some of the pain.

It is also causing me extreme discomfort / lower back pain that  I've never had before.

Also. I'm young, 27, 6'0, 170 lbs, and run / exercise 4+ times a week. 

I've taken  citrucel which just bulks it but still it gets stuck. I had a colonoscopy the dr only found a polyp, 2cm and small hemmroids which he doesn't think is the issue at all.

715,t3_bip1wz,"I began a strict caloric restriction in Sept 2018 and by Jan 2019 had lost around 11kg. When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

Having monitored BM everyday for the past 3 weeks or so, I can see that: for the first week once per 4 day period was typical, but during the past two weeks there was only one day without a BM. Boluses are consistently Bristol 4, minimal discomfort, sense of completion of evacuation is consistently in the 85% + range, and total size is generally large (20 to 30 cm length).

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.  I'm going to try psyllium here soon when I get to the store next but what could possibly be CAUSING this resistance to anything that could soften things up back there?  It's getting to be a little ridiculous, doing everything I can and still tearing open my fissure every.  Damn.  Morning.  Because I can't soften my stools.  


OH and edit:  I went to my PCP's office about a month ago and she seemed completely resistant to any other options for me other than surgery to heal just the fissure and could offer no real suggestions other than referring me to a surgeon.

742,t3_b1lg3w,"Hi everyone,

For the last three months I've been struggling with functional constipation, my doctor seems unsure if it is IBS-C or something else. Sometimes I will have a couple days of ""going normally"" in a row, but then I will get backed up and have no urge to poop at all! Everything feels like it's getting stuck right around my sigmoid.

  
My doctor keeps telling me to use fiber and miralax, with occasional senna, but fiber makes me bloated and even more backed up. I do think it's a motility issue since stuff isn't even reaching my rectum, but obviously I can't use senna every day (I don't want to develop a dependency on it).

749,t3_ayfsfm,"Several minutes after waking up, I felt the need to poop.
After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

It finally hurt so bad that Saturday I went to a chiro because that was the only place open and I just wanted to feel better. Found out that I was constipated. So I went and got some magnesium citrate because i had this happen once about 15 years ago and that’s what they recommended. It helped a little bit but I noticed that I still hadn’t gone to the bathroom two days after I used it. 

On Tuesday my mom had to end up taking me to the ER because my back hurt so bad I thought I was gonna die. While waiting on the drs, my sciatic nerves started to hurt. I mean intense pain from my lower back down both legs, all the way to my toes. The drs came back said I was severely constipated still and let me choose between lactulose or what they give people for colonoscopies. I chose the lactulose because I didn’t want to drink 2 gallons of anything. It seemed to work for a little bit. I’m supposed to take 10ml 3 times a day. After my first dose I went and started clearing out well. Back pain was still there but not as bad. I only took one dose that night because it was late when I got home. 

I took my first dose of the day yesterday, but the second dose all together, and went a little more. The sciatic pain was still reeling it’s head. I’m talking can’t take more than 5 steps before I have to sit, feel like my bones are all breaking, kind of pain. Here we are, two days later, I’ve taken one days worth of full doses, and a dose this morning and I still haven’t gone beyond my second dose. And the pain is getting worse. I don’t know what to do.

When away from home I don't get the urge to defecate at all.  It's not that I have to go and hold it, I just don't have any urge at all.  I usually go about an hour and a half after eating breakfast.  The problem is that I usually eat and and leave for work about 30 minutes later, meaning I don't get to go all day, and maybe the urge doesn't come at home that evening.  Maybe it lasts another day or two.  It's torture.

Recently, I had a friend visit my house.  While he was here, I didn't get the urge at all.  As soon as I dropped him off at the airport and came home, I got the urge within about 10 minutes.  It doesn't make any sense, but it must be deeply rooted psychologically. People I have talked to don't understand at all, and simply claim that it doesn't make sense because having to go is just a physical response, and if you have to go, you go, whenever or wherever.

764,t3_am3srl,"The following are natural remedies for constipation that at first may seem too simple to work, but I’m sure one of these will work for you. 

You will notice a recurring theme here, which is that your bowels are more likely to move first thing in the morning and many of the remedies necessitate you employ them first thing in the morning. 

Feel free to try more than one in the same day, or you can try one at a time. 

1. Drink 1-2 liters of water in a short time span. And then go for a walk. 

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

I wondered if anyone has experienced similar and found improvement by adding fiber or probiotics or something else. I called the doctor and her assistant suggesting alternating Trulance with Miralax on alternate days, or just trying Trulance every other day to see how that would go, which I may try this weekend.",Constipation

790,t3_a8vvm9,"Soo I’m 15 years old and for as long as I can remember I’ve had trouble with constipation. It had never gotten too bad because since about 2nd grade I’ve been on adhd medicine which most of them are stimulants so they have helped keep me regular. But recently, I’ve went to the dr for stomach and side pain, which I assumed was either my ovarian cysts or my kidney cyst which I recently gotten diagnosed with, but the doctor said that they shouldn’t really be causing me pain. So I got an ultrasound and they said that I had mild constipation and told me to take a laxative. Instead I just ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a fiber bar and waited, which helped me finally go to the bathroom. I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up? Anyways I’m going to the bathroom everyday again but only with my adhd medicine and I still don’t go as much as I usually do, I’m trying to incorporate fiber bars into my diet and just improve my diet overall because it’s not the best. But the reason I asked this is because when I talked to my grandmother about it she said it is probably just ibs but idk because it’s not like I have diarrhea sometimes and constpation others, it’s more like I’m usually constipated. Also colon issues run in my family, my mom passed away from colon cancer, my grandmothers brother passed away from diverticulitis because it went untreated, and her other brother also passed away from colon cancer. So I don’t know if this could be related to something like that. It just stresses me out. I havnt been to the dr for this specifically and I don’t know if I should. I’m really lost on what I should do so if anyone has any advice that would be really helpful.",Constipation

794,t3_a50mkk,"Hi all, my history is similar to a post just posted here funny enough, although I have only existed for 20 years, so I only have a 14 year history. Sorry, this is really long, and partially a vent post. please tell me if there is a more appropriate sub for this!

&amp;#x200B;

  
Since I was 6, I've had issues with constipation; I cannot remember a time in my life where I have not had to worry about it. Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help. Or does senna take most of that away? **I know you guys are not doctors, or a substitute, but I need reassurance it'll be ok, or that there's something else I can do to help myself since all but two doctors have dismissed my issues in my 14 years of visits.**     


&amp;#x200B;

**tldr; severe chronic constipation with exceptional pain, don't know how to cope emotionally/physically or advocate for myself, haven't been given enough information on what I've been dealing with. advice/reassurance I'm not going to die when I finally go to the bathroom so I don't hold it in would be appreciated. Or should I just skip all this and head to the ER? Literally anything would help me out right now.** ",Constipation
795,t3_a4p633,"This is a very personal post but a serious problem, not really sure where else on the internet to post this.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out. I drink a LOT of water daily by the way, at least 6 bottles of 16oz water a day.",Constipation

Next, I tried Miralax as I thought that was a strong choice but only pebbles still. I’m now on day 2 of miralax but it wasn’t doing anything so I also took a Dulcolax suppository today. This of course stimulated some bowel movement but it was just getting out hard pebbles still! And that’s where I am now, still feeling the effects of Dulcolax but not really pooping much more. Could it be it was just the pebbles that needed to come out? Will the Dulcolax still do more? It’s been 3 hours now and no real BM have occurred. What should I do? Any advice?

Usually,I would eat a banana every morning and that would help with bowel movements a little, but now I’m finding that they’re not working as well as they did a week ago.

However, I've noticed that I now seem to have a constant mild-moderate lower back pain, directly in the middle of my back above my tailbone area.

About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end! I tried the regular colon cleanse (red bottle) by the same company which is just phsylium husk and other stuff but it's not making much of a difference. 

I had X-rays at a medical clinic done a few months ago saying my colon was fine but was very impacted with feces. When I went for this x-ray I was experiencing horrible stomach pain. The super colon cleanse made that pass in combination with quitting milk. However as I stated I am afraid to take that stuff long term and risk damage though I wonder if the damage from a full colon is even worse. 

One last thing. I don't have a primary care doctor and I don't want to see a specialist.

I'm fuckkinngg sick of not being able to shit properly. A few months ago, I experienced a very sudden change in bowel habits. I went from regular movements ever morning, to not being able to crap at all for five days. By the fifth day, I thought and felt like I was going to explode. 
I began taking fiber to force this shit out, and it worked - although not in satisfactory amounts. 

This has now been my life for the last few months, forcing incomplete bowel movements with fucking fiber. I have an appointment with a gastro doc next month if I make it till then - but I have a hunch I'll need to see a colo-rectal.
The sudden change happened after a wild night.

 *Sex stuff ahead* 

I went to what I'll call a 'party' except it was very little drinking and lots and lots of sex. The men were well endowed, and it was an 'intense' night. I think it fucked up my sigmoid.

I know you shouldn't strain, but I had to pass this thing and eventually it passed like a drain being unblocked with a huge and soft stool behind it. I felt faint and drained, almost like I would pass out.

838,t3_97x6co,"Hey it's me again, I made a post about being constipated some days ago and I wasn't able to pass gas yesterday so I decided to take action today.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out. It continued like a storm and it hurt so fucking bad I could not just stop, the bowel movement was like operating on its own all i could do was control the straining intensity for most part of this traumatic experience. It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax? 
I have my appointment tomorrow so i'll let my GP know but still I'm really shocked/happy but also terrified of this becoming an habit.

843,t3_949taj,"This is happened to me twice in one year, and I'm wondering if its because I have chronic constipation issues. The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better. The next day I was week and exhausted, but felt way better.

Now I thought maybe this had been caused by food poisoning or something, but I'm now wondering if my body is purging itself after being so constipated for so long. 

Has this happened to anyone else out there? Does your body eventually just say, I need a deep cleaning, and put you through this hell?

847,t3_934n6z,"Today, I went to the ER for severe constipation.  Sounds strange right?  

Here's the story.  I have been overall having some issues with constipation ever since I have been in wellburtin xl (generic) about 3 months ago.  I'm currently on the 300 mg.   This medication has been making me constipated.  I've only really been getting minor issues with it initially so I've been just doing the basics in terms of treating the symptoms.  

This week I have been having hard pebble stools (level 1) on the stool chart starting last Monday.  These defecations were 1 a day but only minor stool was passed.  My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.

Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain.

I have tried so many things, I am at a loss - I increase my fibre, and it seems to make my constipation even worse. I take probiotics and magnesium supplements. Literally, the only thing that seems to work is stimulant laxatives (I always take natural ones, but I know long-term use of senna is not good either and can create dependency).

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon.

872,t3_8mwkcq,"I taking sunflower lecithin or Kre-Alkalyn creatine powder triggered the chronic constipation, but I believe it was the sunflower lecithin. The constipation lasted for about 3 months. Lost the urge to go, when I did go, bowel movements were very very weak and only a small amount would come. I had very little ""sensation"", it wouldn't have that ""good"" feeling, it was as if I had become numb in a way. Stool was sticky and very small. I figured it would resolve itself as I have had similar experiences with certain dairy products in the past, but it didn't. I tried magnesium, flax seed, probiotic, vitamin C, water, etc. Searched around on google to try and figure out what was going on, came across these posts:

https://www.curezone.org/forums/fm.asp?i=2240328

I tried DGL and after two days I started to notice some sensation had returned, the movements were a bit stronger, and more was coming. As the days went on, the urge to go became stronger. Before I was really ""listening"" for the slightest indication I needed to go, but after starting DGL I began to notice I had strong enough urges that I had to drop whatever I was doing and go to the rest room.
Now I'm feeling pretty good, maybe 90%, enough to say I feel pretty much back to normal.

Just wanted to put this out there for others to try.

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

This is the DGL I use, I take one in the morning on an empty stomatch with water, coffee an hour later. I usually fast in the morning, I only drink straight coffee, nothing added. Licorice interferes with blood clotting drugs, make sure to read about other contraindications.

Naturally I spent a lot of time reading about constipation and trying different home remedies. Here's what I've settled on.

(1) Drink coffee before eating breakfast. I never used to drink coffee but I gave it a try and it seems to help.

(2) Gradually increased the amount of fiber I eat. Most fruits and vegetables don't contain enough fiber to make it worth eating them. Seriously, look up the number of grams of fiber per 100 grams of apple or celery; it's not worth the trouble of chewing them and swallowing them!

Split peas and lentils, which are very easy to cook, contain a worthwhile amount of fiber. And chia seeds, of course. A tablespoon of chia seeds in 4 tablespoons of warm water forms a disgusting glop that is chock full of healthy fiber.

(3) Take a magnesium supplement. Some days I take magnesium citrate capsules, other days I dissolve half a teaspoon of epsom salt (which is magnesium sulfate) in water and chug it down.

(4) I reduced my consumption of bananas, cheese, and calcium-based antacids (Tums). I read that they have a ""binding"" effect on some people.

I am a 19 year old female. 
I have been constipated since the 31st of December. It was a Saturday night. The last thing I ate that night was a takeaway pizza. Now, usually after eating pizza I get diarrhoea, so I was curious the next morning when I realised the food didn't exit my body. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, I bought Ducolax laxatives and they worked their magic on my bowels within 4 hours. I took another pill on Thursday as I had ate a lot of food that week and my bowels didn't seem to be working on their own. The pill didn't work. I took another laxative on Friday which didn't work also. 

I bought Milk of Magnesia, which is magnesium hydroxide, and it worked on the Saturday of that week. I drank 6 5 ml cups of the milk last night and I've had diarrhoea 4 times since then. Diarrhoea is a side effect of the milk. I examined my stool and it was paper thin and had ragged edges, does that make sense? It looked like pieces of ripped toilet paper. 
I have been smelling a foul odor in my mouth, but I brush my teeth many times a day and I am drinking lots of water. I think it is the food rotting inside my body.

Have you ever experienced difficulty in passing your bowels? Almost everyone goes through this at some point in their lives. Being constipated is not a very serious issue but it can be discomforting if it happens often.

When a person has bowel movements less than three times a week or if you have pain or strain while passing your daily motion, you could be suffering from constipation.

While there are no “right” number of times you out to move your bowels, medical experts say it you should pass motion at least once a day.

The most common symptoms of constipation are:

You suffer from bloating or abdominal cramps
Movement of bowels requires a lot of strain
Hard or small stools
You have to depend on laxatives or special food such as yogurt, cereals packed with fiber or oatmeal, juices etcetera
Constipation is usually caused by a number of factors, some of them are:

Low water intake
Lack of fibrous food in the diet
Lack of physical exercise
Over dose of laxatives
There are many ways to avoid constipation in both adults and kids. Here, we list out a few home remedies for constipation or certain treatments that you can perform by yourself to help cure constipation.

Include high fibre food in your diet.
Fibrous food prevents your stools from becoming hard. They help in adding bulk in your motion. When you start adding fibrous food in your diet, ensure you do so little by little as your digestive system will need to get used to it. Some examples of fibrous food are split peas, lentils, black beans, avocado, bran flakes, whole wheat pasta, pearled barley, oatmeal.
Increase water intake.
One well known method to prevent constipation is to liquid forms of food such as soups and juices in one’s diet. Movement of bowels is easier as the stool becomes bulky and softer because of the increased fluid in the colon. Medical experts recommend an adult drinks 2 liters of water a day.
Regular physical exercise.
Doctors recommend that individuals exercise at least 30 minutes every day. Regular exercise enhances blood flow and keeps the various organs active thereby improving digestion.
Keeping these tips in mind, you can prevent constipation. There are many supplements that will help you add fibre into your diet.

Today is day 8, and I took a full dose (30ml) of Milk of Magnesia this morning and it only resulted in a few small bursts of green powdery-looking diarrhea — which I sense may be the Metamucil fiber mixed with the green chlorophyll of all the vegetables I'm eating.

942,t3_bknygc,"TL;DR : I'm a programmer and I stopped slouching on my chair at work.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a programmer, I'm at my desk monday to friday. I lift weights 3 times a week for 1.5 hours each time. I drink at least 2 liters of water per day, I drink coffee, I eat veggies and I eat spicy food. I've had pretty bad constipation issues for the past 3.5 years (taking a shit one day per week, often by using senna). I've tried a ton of things, including huge amounts of fiber supplements, fibrous foods and  PEG 3350. Nothing worked for more than two weeks. I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

It's the ONLY thing that changed during that time. I don't know the science that could explain why I don't have issues anymore. The only thing there is is that my lower back stays perpendicular to the ground for a longer period per day than before.",Constipation

To start off I am 17 y/o, and I haven't been a regular pooper for as long as I remember, I just want to share my story today because before it happened I never thought that I'll make it out of this. 

Basically, this may be a little fucked up but I like holding my poo in, I know. I haven't pooped in like 2.5 weeks and things got real bad real quick, I started losing my appetite, I couldn't eat at all and even if I ate, I'd puke it right away. my poo started to leak while the hard bit wouldn't come out. when I realized how bad things got, I started to go to the toilet but, no joy. I'd spend hours in there just to get a little bit of it out, with indescribable pain.

I have tried macrogol 4000, sodium picosulfate, nothing worked at all until this morning, I told my mother to take me to the doctor and I told him all about this, he prescribed docusate sodium, the ones that you administer rectally, and thank god it worked. 

I feel so much better now though I don't think I have defecated completely, I'm planning on going in again tonight to try to fully empty my stomach.

Since taking more fiber / changing my diet a little bit more I've taken care of a lot of that, but now It seems stuck a little higher up the rectum, about 4 inches in and I have to manually pull it out (as gross as it sounds) in order to relieve some of the pain.

It is also causing me extreme discomfort / lower back pain that  I've never had before.

Also. I'm young, 27, 6'0, 170 lbs, and run / exercise 4+ times a week. 

I've taken  citrucel which just bulks it but still it gets stuck. I had a colonoscopy the dr only found a polyp, 2cm and small hemmroids which he doesn't think is the issue at all.

948,t3_bip1wz,"I began a strict caloric restriction in Sept 2018 and by Jan 2019 had lost around 11kg. When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

Having monitored BM everyday for the past 3 weeks or so, I can see that: for the first week once per 4 day period was typical, but during the past two weeks there was only one day without a BM. Boluses are consistently Bristol 4, minimal discomfort, sense of completion of evacuation is consistently in the 85% + range, and total size is generally large (20 to 30 cm length).

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.  I'm going to try psyllium here soon when I get to the store next but what could possibly be CAUSING this resistance to anything that could soften things up back there?  It's getting to be a little ridiculous, doing everything I can and still tearing open my fissure every.  Damn.  Morning.  Because I can't soften my stools.  


OH and edit:  I went to my PCP's office about a month ago and she seemed completely resistant to any other options for me other than surgery to heal just the fissure and could offer no real suggestions other than referring me to a surgeon.

After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

I took my first dose of the day yesterday, but the second dose all together, and went a little more. The sciatic pain was still reeling it’s head. I’m talking can’t take more than 5 steps before I have to sit, feel like my bones are all breaking, kind of pain. Here we are, two days later, I’ve taken one days worth of full doses, and a dose this morning and I still haven’t gone beyond my second dose. And the pain is getting worse. I don’t know what to do. I’m at the point where I would rather die than feel like this.

987,t3_awvsdb,"I haven't had much luck finding anyone else who has this, but it caused me a problem my whole life.

When away from home I don't get the urge to defecate at all.  It's not that I have to go and hold it, I just don't have any urge at all.  I usually go about an hour and a half after eating breakfast.  The problem is that I usually eat and and leave for work about 30 minutes later, meaning I don't get to go all day, and maybe the urge doesn't come at home that evening.  Maybe it lasts another day or two.  It's torture.

Recently, I had a friend visit my house.  While he was here, I didn't get the urge at all.  As soon as I dropped him off at the airport and came home, I got the urge within about 10 minutes.  It doesn't make any sense, but it must be deeply rooted psychologically. People I have talked to don't understand at all, and simply claim that it doesn't make sense because having to go is just a physical response, and if you have to go, you go, whenever or wherever.

I'm amazed at people who defecate in public restrooms. I want to, but don't get the urge away from home.

997,t3_am3srl,"The following are natural remedies for constipation that at first may seem too simple to work, but I’m sure one of these will work for you. 

You will notice a recurring theme here, which is that your bowels are more likely to move first thing in the morning and many of the remedies necessitate you employ them first thing in the morning. 

Feel free to try more than one in the same day, or you can try one at a time. 

1. Drink 1-2 liters of water in a short time span. And then go for a walk. 

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

* I started drinking twice as much water and that absolutely helped.
* I make sure to walk enough each day. 
* I took a laxative in hopes that I could break up any blockages a month ago. That seemed to get things moving.  It was only on one occasion, but it seemed effective.
* Eat less sugar. 
* I also started making my own bread. Nothing fancy, just some homemade wheat bread and white bread. That has made a big difference! I eat bread everyday at breakfast. I'm not sure if its the fiber increase, or maybe eliminating some preservatives  from my diet that are in store-bought bread, but I haven't had an issue since.

It had never gotten too bad because since about 2nd grade I’ve been on adhd medicine which most of them are stimulants so they have helped keep me regular. But recently, I’ve went to the dr for stomach and side pain, which I assumed was either my ovarian cysts or my kidney cyst which I recently gotten diagnosed with, but the doctor said that they shouldn’t really be causing me pain. So I got an ultrasound and they said that I had mild constipation and told me to take a laxative. Instead I just ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a fiber bar and waited, which helped me finally go to the bathroom. I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up?

&amp;#x200B;

  
Since I was 6, I've had issues with constipation; I cannot remember a time in my life where I have not had to worry about it. Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help.

1028,t3_a4p633,"This is a very personal post but a serious problem, not really sure where else on the internet to post this.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out. I drink a LOT of water daily by the way, at least 6 bottles of 16oz water a day.",Constipation
1029,t3_a3w1b1,"It’s been about a week and a half where I haven’t had a good BM. I’ve only been passing small, hard pebbles and straining a lot :( at first I tried prunelax as I thought something gentle would do me good but only pebbles the next day still. Next, I tried Miralax as I thought that was a strong choice but only pebbles still. I’m now on day 2 of miralax but it wasn’t doing anything so I also took a Dulcolax suppository today. This of course stimulated some bowel movement but it was just getting out hard pebbles still! And that’s where I am now, still feeling the effects of Dulcolax but not really pooping much more. Could it be it was just the pebbles that needed to come out? Will the Dulcolax still do more? It’s been 3 hours now and no real BM have occurred. What should I do? Any advice?

I just feel like I can’t go the way I used to anymore. The bloating is sometimes uncomfortable. Usually,I would eat a banana every morning and that would help with bowel movements a little, but now I’m finding that they’re not working as well as they did a week ago.

However, I've noticed that I now seem to have a constant mild-moderate lower back pain, directly in the middle of my back above my tailbone area.

I had a hemmoroidectomy to remove horribly large external ones but internal ones were left untouched due to safety concerns with my surgeon. I also got sick a lot as a kid. 

I used to drink milk constantly. I have now since cut that out mostly and only drink a coffee a day and water. I eat blue berry fiber bars everyday and salad. I've had prune juice, stool softeners, mild laxatives all yielding various to no results. Finally I found super colon cleanse (green bottle) in pill form.  Taking it gave me mad painful stomach cramps and sometimes diaherreha but afterwards I felt so much better. Didn't feel like I had to go the rest of the day. Stopped getting sick, migraines, and other stomach related issues. 

 The bottle says to only take it for 10 days every two months. I tried that and went right back to having a hard time passing anything. So I went back on it. I didn't always take 4 pills a day sometimes only 2 or even none but I went far beyond the 10 days. About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end! I tried the regular colon cleanse (red bottle) by the same company which is just phsylium husk and other stuff but it's not making much of a difference.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out.

It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax? 
I have my appointment tomorrow so i'll let my GP know but still I'm really shocked/happy but also terrified of this becoming an habit.

1076,t3_949taj,"This is happened to me twice in one year, and I'm wondering if its because I have chronic constipation issues. The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better. The next day I was week and exhausted, but felt way better.

Now I thought maybe this had been caused by food poisoning or something, but I'm now wondering if my body is purging itself after being so constipated for so long. 

Has this happened to anyone else out there? Does your body eventually just say, I need a deep cleaning, and put you through this hell?

1080,t3_934n6z,"Today, I went to the ER for severe constipation.  Sounds strange right?  

Here's the story.  I have been overall having some issues with constipation ever since I have been in wellburtin xl (generic) about 3 months ago.  I'm currently on the 300 mg.   This medication has been making me constipated.  I've only really been getting minor issues with it initially so I've been just doing the basics in terms of treating the symptoms.  

This week I have been having hard pebble stools (level 1) on the stool chart starting last Monday.  These defecations were 1 a day but only minor stool was passed.  My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.

**ISSUE:** I get constipation regularly. About half the days in a given month I am constipated. It takes the form of: In ability to pass stool. Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain. Of course this causes stress and a clouded mind/ bad mood whenever I'm like this because who wouldn't be upset when they can't poop? I get pain in the TOP of my stomach, the ascending colon (look down front right part of abdominal area above the pelvis.), and my right side.   

**TYPICAL PERIOD OF CONSTIPATION:**  Anywhere from 7-14 days. ( if it becomes the longer I end up eating soft foods and/or having little hunger.)

**TRIED METHODS:**  Smooth move tea ( worked when I was a kid, not anymore) , Miralax, Olive oil ( works on occasion if things are not too stuck up), Metamucil, changing diet and exercise ( and sticking to it), Increasing liquid intake, increasing fiber from diet, v8, juices, dried fruits, stretching, self massage ( only works if stomach is not tight from pain or distention which it is tight 9/10 times) , PT for corrective breathing/pushing. GI given trial of linzess.

**COLONOSCOPY:** Came back 100&amp;#37; clean.

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon.

I tried DGL and after two days I started to notice some sensation had returned, the movements were a bit stronger, and more was coming. As the days went on, the urge to go became stronger. Before I was really ""listening"" for the slightest indication I needed to go, but after starting DGL I began to notice I had strong enough urges that I had to drop whatever I was doing and go to the rest room.
Now I'm feeling pretty good, maybe 90%, enough to say I feel pretty much back to normal.

Just wanted to put this out there for others to try.

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

This is the DGL I use, I take one in the morning on an empty stomatch with water, coffee an hour later. I usually fast in the morning, I only drink straight coffee, nothing added. Licorice interferes with blood clotting drugs, make sure to read about other contraindications.

Naturally I spent a lot of time reading about constipation and trying different home remedies. Here's what I've settled on.

(1) Drink coffee before eating breakfast. I never used to drink coffee but I gave it a try and it seems to help.

(2) Gradually increased the amount of fiber I eat. Most fruits and vegetables don't contain enough fiber to make it worth eating them. Seriously, look up the number of grams of fiber per 100 grams of apple or celery; it's not worth the trouble of chewing them and swallowing them!

Split peas and lentils, which are very easy to cook, contain a worthwhile amount of fiber. And chia seeds, of course. A tablespoon of chia seeds in 4 tablespoons of warm water forms a disgusting glop that is chock full of healthy fiber.

(3) Take a magnesium supplement. Some days I take magnesium citrate capsules, other days I dissolve half a teaspoon of epsom salt (which is magnesium sulfate) in water and chug it down.

(4) I reduced my consumption of bananas, cheese, and calcium-based antacids (Tums). I read that they have a ""binding"" effect on some people.

I am a 19 year old female. 
I have been constipated since the 31st of December. It was a Saturday night. The last thing I ate that night was a takeaway pizza. Now, usually after eating pizza I get diarrhoea, so I was curious the next morning when I realised the food didn't exit my body. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, I bought Ducolax laxatives and they worked their magic on my bowels within 4 hours. I took another pill on Thursday as I had ate a lot of food that week and my bowels didn't seem to be working on their own. The pill didn't work. I took another laxative on Friday which didn't work also. 

I bought Milk of Magnesia, which is magnesium hydroxide, and it worked on the Saturday of that week. I drank 6 5 ml cups of the milk last night and I've had diarrhoea 4 times since then. Diarrhoea is a side effect of the milk. I examined my stool and it was paper thin and had ragged edges, does that make sense? It looked like pieces of ripped toilet paper. 
I have been smelling a foul odor in my mouth, but I brush my teeth many times a day and I am drinking lots of water. I think it is the food rotting inside my body. 
Does anyone have any suggestions for what could be wrong?

Have you ever experienced difficulty in passing your bowels? Almost everyone goes through this at some point in their lives. Being constipated is not a very serious issue but it can be discomforting if it happens often.

When a person has bowel movements less than three times a week or if you have pain or strain while passing your daily motion, you could be suffering from constipation.

While there are no “right” number of times you out to move your bowels, medical experts say it you should pass motion at least once a day.

The most common symptoms of constipation are:

You suffer from bloating or abdominal cramps
Movement of bowels requires a lot of strain
Hard or small stools
You have to depend on laxatives or special food such as yogurt, cereals packed with fiber or oatmeal, juices etcetera
Constipation is usually caused by a number of factors, some of them are:

Low water intake
Lack of fibrous food in the diet
Lack of physical exercise
Over dose of laxatives
There are many ways to avoid constipation in both adults and kids. Here, we list out a few home remedies for constipation or certain treatments that you can perform by yourself to help cure constipation.

Include high fibre food in your diet.
Fibrous food prevents your stools from becoming hard. They help in adding bulk in your motion. When you start adding fibrous food in your diet, ensure you do so little by little as your digestive system will need to get used to it. Some examples of fibrous food are split peas, lentils, black beans, avocado, bran flakes, whole wheat pasta, pearled barley, oatmeal.
Increase water intake.
One well known method to prevent constipation is to liquid forms of food such as soups and juices in one’s diet. Movement of bowels is easier as the stool becomes bulky and softer because of the increased fluid in the colon. Medical experts recommend an adult drinks 2 liters of water a day.
Regular physical exercise.
Doctors recommend that individuals exercise at least 30 minutes every day. Regular exercise enhances blood flow and keeps the various organs active thereby improving digestion.
Keeping these tips in mind, you can prevent constipation. There are many supplements that will help you add fibre into your diet.

I've had pretty bad constipation issues for the past 3.5 years (taking a shit one day per week, often by using senna). I've tried a ton of things, including huge amounts of fiber supplements, fibrous foods and  PEG 3350. Nothing worked for more than two weeks. I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

Having monitored BM everyday for the past 3 weeks or so, I can see that: for the first week once per 4 day period was typical, but during the past two weeks there was only one day without a BM.

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.  I'm going to try psyllium here soon when I get to the store next but what could possibly be CAUSING this resistance to anything that could soften things up back there?  It's getting to be a little ridiculous, doing everything I can and still tearing open my fissure every.  Damn.  Morning.  Because I can't soften my stools.  


OH and edit:  I went to my PCP's office about a month ago and she seemed completely resistant to any other options for me other than surgery to heal just the fissure and could offer no real suggestions other than referring me to a surgeon.  This is something I am going to avoid as long as possible because I'm certain the reason I'm not healing is because my ass just refuses to pass anything but rock hard lumps.

After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

I chose the lactulose because I didn’t want to drink 2 gallons of anything. It seemed to work for a little bit. I’m supposed to take 10ml 3 times a day. After my first dose I went and started clearing out well. Back pain was still there but not as bad. I only took one dose that night because it was late when I got home.

And this could have just been a virus or something, but I was having problems, had fallen into the tub once (thankfully I didn't hit myself hard), and kept going in and out of consciousness.  At one point, I finally came to and found I had thrown up all over the little rug in front of me.

1230,t3_am3srl,"The following are natural remedies for constipation that at first may seem too simple to work, but I’m sure one of these will work for you. 

You will notice a recurring theme here, which is that your bowels are more likely to move first thing in the morning and many of the remedies necessitate you employ them first thing in the morning. 

Feel free to try more than one in the same day, or you can try one at a time. 

1. Drink 1-2 liters of water in a short time span. And then go for a walk. 

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

So I'm stuck here, in this tiny apartment which i don't even feel comfy. And besides the comfort, the kitchen is 2 steps away from the toilet and also the living area is like 5 steps and the only room is just next to the toilet.

My main question is, should I be concerned? 

My doctor wasn't exactly... Helpful. She suggested Miralax, which I am in the middle of trying, and said she would percribe something if that didnt help. In the back of my mind I am wondering if something more serious could be going on. She ordered an x-ray and an ultrasound which came back normal, besides showing I was constipated (surprise!)

* I started drinking twice as much water and that absolutely helped.
* I make sure to walk enough each day. 
* I took a laxative in hopes that I could break up any blockages a month ago. That seemed to get things moving.  It was only on one occasion, but it seemed effective.
* Eat less sugar. 
* I also started making my own bread. Nothing fancy, just some homemade wheat bread and white bread. That has made a big difference! I eat bread everyday at breakfast. I'm not sure if its the fiber increase, or maybe eliminating some preservatives  from my diet that are in store-bought bread, but I haven't had an issue since.

1256,t3_a8vvm9,"Soo I’m 15 years old and for as long as I can remember I’ve had trouble with constipation. It had never gotten too bad because since about 2nd grade I’ve been on adhd medicine which most of them are stimulants so they have helped keep me regular. But recently, I’ve went to the dr for stomach and side pain, which I assumed was either my ovarian cysts or my kidney cyst which I recently gotten diagnosed with, but the doctor said that they shouldn’t really be causing me pain. So I got an ultrasound and they said that I had mild constipation and told me to take a laxative. Instead I just ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a fiber bar and waited, which helped me finally go to the bathroom. I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up?

&amp;#x200B;

  
Since I was 6, I've had issues with constipation; I cannot remember a time in my life where I have not had to worry about it. Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help. Or does senna take most of that away? **I know you guys are not doctors, or a substitute, but I need reassurance it'll be ok, or that there's something else I can do to help myself since all but two doctors have dismissed my issues in my 14 years of visits.**     


&amp;#x200B;

**tldr; severe chronic constipation with exceptional pain, don't know how to cope emotionally/physically or advocate for myself, haven't been given enough information on what I've been dealing with. advice/reassurance I'm not going to die when I finally go to the bathroom so I don't hold it in would be appreciated. Or should I just skip all this and head to the ER? Literally anything would help me out right now.** ",Constipation
1261,t3_a4p633,"This is a very personal post but a serious problem, not really sure where else on the internet to post this.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out.

Sometimes I get these HORRIBLE stomach cramps from being too constipated and they only go away when I poop, but sometimes I may not get the urge to do so for a day or two and the pain is just so awful. Like you’re being stabbed. 

I prefer to try and avoid laxatives because I’m afraid of them making the cramping even more worse and intense. Which is probably stupid of me, I know.

The only reasons why I think this happened was that I was eating a lot if great food that was home cooked, as well as almost walking 7 miles a day around the festival grounds. My husband also felt this. 

Usually when I travel it’s the opposite!!

Is it really as simple as avoiding processed foods and exercising? Or is there something in the water in New Orleans?

I had a hemmoroidectomy to remove horribly large external ones but internal ones were left untouched due to safety concerns with my surgeon. I also got sick a lot as a kid. 

I used to drink milk constantly. I have now since cut that out mostly and only drink a coffee a day and water. I eat blue berry fiber bars everyday and salad. I've had prune juice, stool softeners, mild laxatives all yielding various to no results. Finally I found super colon cleanse (green bottle) in pill form.  Taking it gave me mad painful stomach cramps and sometimes diaherreha but afterwards I felt so much better. Didn't feel like I had to go the rest of the day. Stopped getting sick, migraines, and other stomach related issues. 

 The bottle says to only take it for 10 days every two months. I tried that and went right back to having a hard time passing anything. So I went back on it. I didn't always take 4 pills a day sometimes only 2 or even none but I went far beyond the 10 days. About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end! I tried the regular colon cleanse (red bottle) by the same company which is just phsylium husk and other stuff but it's not making much of a difference. 

I had X-rays at a medical clinic done a few months ago saying my colon was fine but was very impacted with feces. When I went for this x-ray I was experiencing horrible stomach pain. The super colon cleanse made that pass in combination with quitting milk. However as I stated I am afraid to take that stuff long term and risk damage though I wonder if the damage from a full colon is even worse.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out. It continued like a storm and it hurt so fucking bad I could not just stop, the bowel movement was like operating on its own all i could do was control the straining intensity for most part of this traumatic experience. It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax?

The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better. The next day I was week and exhausted, but felt way better.

Now I thought maybe this had been caused by food poisoning or something, but I'm now wondering if my body is purging itself after being so constipated for so long.

1313,t3_934n6z,"Today, I went to the ER for severe constipation.  Sounds strange right?  

Here's the story.  I have been overall having some issues with constipation ever since I have been in wellburtin xl (generic) about 3 months ago.  I'm currently on the 300 mg.   This medication has been making me constipated.  I've only really been getting minor issues with it initially so I've been just doing the basics in terms of treating the symptoms.  

This week I have been having hard pebble stools (level 1) on the stool chart starting last Monday.  These defecations were 1 a day but only minor stool was passed.  My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.  

Is it possible to rip your rectum or rupture during a massive stool/constipation?

**ISSUE:** I get constipation regularly. About half the days in a given month I am constipated. It takes the form of: In ability to pass stool. Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain. Of course this causes stress and a clouded mind/ bad mood whenever I'm like this because who wouldn't be upset when they can't poop? I get pain in the TOP of my stomach, the ascending colon (look down front right part of abdominal area above the pelvis.), and my right side.   

**TYPICAL PERIOD OF CONSTIPATION:**  Anywhere from 7-14 days. ( if it becomes the longer I end up eating soft foods and/or having little hunger.)

**TRIED METHODS:**  Smooth move tea ( worked when I was a kid, not anymore) , Miralax, Olive oil ( works on occasion if things are not too stuck up), Metamucil, changing diet and exercise ( and sticking to it), Increasing liquid intake, increasing fiber from diet, v8, juices, dried fruits, stretching, self massage ( only works if stomach is not tight from pain or distention which it is tight 9/10 times) , PT for corrective breathing/pushing. GI given trial of linzess.

**COLONOSCOPY:** Came back 100&amp;#37; clean. 

**SEEN GI:**  Report told me I suffer from IBS -C ( aka they don't have a root cause) , and he is worried I may develop colon cancer in 10 years from the chronic stress on my colon ( also some adjacent family history of colon cancer.

People. If I'm honest with myself sometimes I think whether life like this is livable.

Doctors do not seem to think it is an issue that I have to use natural laxative agents to go - if I do not take these I can go up to 2 weeks without having a single bowel movement. I have tried so many things, I am at a loss - I increase my fibre, and it seems to make my constipation even worse. I take probiotics and magnesium supplements. Literally, the only thing that seems to work is stimulant laxatives (I always take natural ones, but I know long-term use of senna is not good either and can create dependency).

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon. This could very well be the case, but then do I not have any other choice but to take stimulant laxatives for relief?

Does anyone know if constipation could be a sign of specific types of allergies? I want to request allergy testing from my doctor, but wnat to know what I am asking for. I know I will ask for dairy allergy testing, and perhaps gluten as well. 

On a side note, I also have a hormonal imbalance - I am not sure if this could possibly be related to my constipation but I have an excess of androgens in my system (I am female btw) - possible Polycystic Ovarian System (not yet confirmed).

I tried DGL and after two days I started to notice some sensation had returned, the movements were a bit stronger, and more was coming. As the days went on, the urge to go became stronger. Before I was really ""listening"" for the slightest indication I needed to go, but after starting DGL I began to notice I had strong enough urges that I had to drop whatever I was doing and go to the rest room.
Now I'm feeling pretty good, maybe 90%, enough to say I feel pretty much back to normal.

Just wanted to put this out there for others to try.

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

This is the DGL I use, I take one in the morning on an empty stomatch with water, coffee an hour later. I usually fast in the morning, I only drink straight coffee, nothing added. Licorice interferes with blood clotting drugs, make sure to read about other contraindications.

1375,t3_5vvryq,"A year ago my guts slowed down, don't know why, but I was only pooping once every 5 or 6 days. The turds were hard as rocks, the diameter was large, and it took 20 or 30 minutes to get them out of me.

Naturally I spent a lot of time reading about constipation and trying different home remedies. Here's what I've settled on.

(1) Drink coffee before eating breakfast. I never used to drink coffee but I gave it a try and it seems to help.

(2) Gradually increased the amount of fiber I eat. Most fruits and vegetables don't contain enough fiber to make it worth eating them. Seriously, look up the number of grams of fiber per 100 grams of apple or celery; it's not worth the trouble of chewing them and swallowing them!

Split peas and lentils, which are very easy to cook, contain a worthwhile amount of fiber. And chia seeds, of course. A tablespoon of chia seeds in 4 tablespoons of warm water forms a disgusting glop that is chock full of healthy fiber.

(3) Take a magnesium supplement. Some days I take magnesium citrate capsules, other days I dissolve half a teaspoon of epsom salt (which is magnesium sulfate) in water and chug it down.

(4) I reduced my consumption of bananas, cheese, and calcium-based antacids (Tums). I read that they have a ""binding"" effect on some people.

There you go. Good luck, my fellow poop warriors!",Constipation

1378,t3_5nmxg6,"Hello, 
I am a 19 year old female. 
I have been constipated since the 31st of December. It was a Saturday night. The last thing I ate that night was a takeaway pizza. Now, usually after eating pizza I get diarrhoea, so I was curious the next morning when I realised the food didn't exit my body. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, I bought Ducolax laxatives and they worked their magic on my bowels within 4 hours. I took another pill on Thursday as I had ate a lot of food that week and my bowels didn't seem to be working on their own. The pill didn't work. I took another laxative on Friday which didn't work also. 

I bought Milk of Magnesia, which is magnesium hydroxide, and it worked on the Saturday of that week. I drank 6 5 ml cups of the milk last night and I've had diarrhoea 4 times since then. Diarrhoea is a side effect of the milk. I examined my stool and it was paper thin and had ragged edges, does that make sense? It looked like pieces of ripped toilet paper. 
I have been smelling a foul odor in my mouth, but I brush my teeth many times a day and I am drinking lots of water. I think it is the food rotting inside my body. 
Does anyone have any suggestions for what could be wrong? 


Tl;dr Never been constipated before. Can't poop without the help of laxatives.",Constipation

Have you ever experienced difficulty in passing your bowels? Almost everyone goes through this at some point in their lives. Being constipated is not a very serious issue but it can be discomforting if it happens often.

When a person has bowel movements less than three times a week or if you have pain or strain while passing your daily motion, you could be suffering from constipation.

While there are no “right” number of times you out to move your bowels, medical experts say it you should pass motion at least once a day.

The most common symptoms of constipation are:

You suffer from bloating or abdominal cramps
Movement of bowels requires a lot of strain
Hard or small stools
You have to depend on laxatives or special food such as yogurt, cereals packed with fiber or oatmeal, juices etcetera
Constipation is usually caused by a number of factors, some of them are:

Low water intake
Lack of fibrous food in the diet
Lack of physical exercise
Over dose of laxatives
There are many ways to avoid constipation in both adults and kids. Here, we list out a few home remedies for constipation or certain treatments that you can perform by yourself to help cure constipation.

Include high fibre food in your diet.
Fibrous food prevents your stools from becoming hard. They help in adding bulk in your motion. When you start adding fibrous food in your diet, ensure you do so little by little as your digestive system will need to get used to it. Some examples of fibrous food are split peas, lentils, black beans, avocado, bran flakes, whole wheat pasta, pearled barley, oatmeal.
Increase water intake.
One well known method to prevent constipation is to liquid forms of food such as soups and juices in one’s diet. Movement of bowels is easier as the stool becomes bulky and softer because of the increased fluid in the colon. Medical experts recommend an adult drinks 2 liters of water a day.
Regular physical exercise.
Doctors recommend that individuals exercise at least 30 minutes every day. Regular exercise enhances blood flow and keeps the various organs active thereby improving digestion.
Keeping these tips in mind, you can prevent constipation. There are many supplements that will help you add fibre into your diet.

Basically, I've only had small pebbles / small pencil-shaped BMs for around 8 or 9 days now. No sizable BMs. I was very dehydrated and eating horribly when this started (an anomaly for me) which almost certainly triggered it, so I've been drinking 3 liters of water and eating much much healthier every day since.

I went to a GI doctor 4 days ago and he told me to take Miralax once daily and to supplement with Metamucil if I want, which I've been doing. It hasn't really helped as far as I can tell. I'm not in pain, just mild discomfort, but I'm a little worried and want to nip this in the bud. Today is day 8, and I took a full dose (30ml) of Milk of Magnesia this morning and it only resulted in a few small bursts of green powdery-looking diarrhea — which I sense may be the Metamucil fiber mixed with the green chlorophyll of all the vegetables I'm eating. Now I've just inserted a glycerin suppository 30 minutes ago but I'm not really feeling anything at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a programmer, I'm at my desk monday to friday. I lift weights 3 times a week for 1.5 hours each time. I drink at least 2 liters of water per day, I drink coffee, I eat veggies and I eat spicy food. I've had pretty bad constipation issues for the past 3.5 years (taking a shit one day per week, often by using senna). I've tried a ton of things, including huge amounts of fiber supplements, fibrous foods and  PEG 3350. Nothing worked for more than two weeks. I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

It's the ONLY thing that changed during that time. I don't know the science that could explain why I don't have issues anymore. The only thing there is is that my lower back stays perpendicular to the ground for a longer period per day than before.",Constipation

When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

Having monitored BM everyday for the past 3 weeks or so, I can see that: for the first week once per 4 day period was typical, but during the past two weeks there was only one day without a BM.

1435,t3_b6s95d,"Enjoy my throwaway username lol

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.  I'm going to try psyllium here soon when I get to the store next but what could possibly be CAUSING this resistance to anything that could soften things up back there?  It's getting to be a little ridiculous, doing everything I can and still tearing open my fissure every.  Damn.  Morning.  Because I can't soften my stools.  


OH and edit:  I went to my PCP's office about a month ago and she seemed completely resistant to any other options for me other than surgery to heal just the fissure and could offer no real suggestions other than referring me to a surgeon.  This is something I am going to avoid as long as possible because I'm certain the reason I'm not healing is because my ass just refuses to pass anything but rock hard lumps.

1448,t3_ayfsfm,"Several minutes after waking up, I felt the need to poop.
After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

It finally hurt so bad that Saturday I went to a chiro because that was the only place open and I just wanted to feel better. Found out that I was constipated. So I went and got some magnesium citrate because i had this happen once about 15 years ago and that’s what they recommended. It helped a little bit but I noticed that I still hadn’t gone to the bathroom two days after I used it. 

On Tuesday my mom had to end up taking me to the ER because my back hurt so bad I thought I was gonna die. While waiting on the drs, my sciatic nerves started to hurt. I mean intense pain from my lower back down both legs, all the way to my toes. The drs came back said I was severely constipated still and let me choose between lactulose or what they give people for colonoscopies. I chose the lactulose because I didn’t want to drink 2 gallons of anything. It seemed to work for a little bit. I’m supposed to take 10ml 3 times a day. After my first dose I went and started clearing out well. Back pain was still there but not as bad. I only took one dose that night because it was late when I got home. 

I took my first dose of the day yesterday, but the second dose all together, and went a little more. The sciatic pain was still reeling it’s head. I’m talking can’t take more than 5 steps before I have to sit, feel like my bones are all breaking, kind of pain.

I usually go about an hour and a half after eating breakfast.

1463,t3_am3srl,"The following are natural remedies for constipation that at first may seem too simple to work, but I’m sure one of these will work for you. 

You will notice a recurring theme here, which is that your bowels are more likely to move first thing in the morning and many of the remedies necessitate you employ them first thing in the morning. 

Feel free to try more than one in the same day, or you can try one at a time. 

1. Drink 1-2 liters of water in a short time span. And then go for a walk. 

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

I realized that even though its whole wheat with fiber, the bread ITSELF was the one causing the majority of my chronic constipation. I stopped intaking bread.. or at least limiting it substantially to the point where after 4 to 5 months I've been mainly constipated free with normal bowel movements. Occasional constipation, but I've managed to be able to go daily. I can even ingest a lot of cheese now crazy enough.

But about 2 years ago, I started noticing something different. It hurt a lot to relieve myself and I'd have to strain to get the shit out. And it came out a little dry. I didn't really see it as a problem and just got through it. I should also mention that since I was a child, whenever I had the urge to go, I held it back until I couldn't. I thought that this was something that was just a normal thing to do. Anyway for two years, I just went through the pain and dry poop (it happened irregularly. Somedays I went to poop without any pain or strain). However a month ago, something changed. I went an entire week and a half without pooping. And I could feel my stomach getting bigger, like there was a load on it, but I just didn't have the urge to go. When I went to the doctor, he simply gave simple laxative medicine and some diet advice, however a month has gone by and I cannot poop naturally.

1489,t3_a8vvm9,"Soo I’m 15 years old and for as long as I can remember I’ve had trouble with constipation. It had never gotten too bad because since about 2nd grade I’ve been on adhd medicine which most of them are stimulants so they have helped keep me regular. But recently, I’ve went to the dr for stomach and side pain, which I assumed was either my ovarian cysts or my kidney cyst which I recently gotten diagnosed with, but the doctor said that they shouldn’t really be causing me pain. So I got an ultrasound and they said that I had mild constipation and told me to take a laxative. Instead I just ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a fiber bar and waited, which helped me finally go to the bathroom. I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up? Anyways I’m going to the bathroom everyday again but only with my adhd medicine and I still don’t go as much as I usually do, I’m trying to incorporate fiber bars into my diet and just improve my diet overall because it’s not the best. But the reason I asked this is because when I talked to my grandmother about it she said it is probably just ibs but idk because it’s not like I have diarrhea sometimes and constpation others, it’s more like I’m usually constipated. Also colon issues run in my family, my mom passed away from colon cancer, my grandmothers brother passed away from diverticulitis because it went untreated, and her other brother also passed away from colon cancer. So I don’t know if this could be related to something like that. It just stresses me out. I havnt been to the dr for this specifically and I don’t know if I should.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Since I was 6, I've had issues with constipation; I cannot remember a time in my life where I have not had to worry about it. Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help. Or does senna take most of that away? **I know you guys are not doctors, or a substitute, but I need reassurance it'll be ok, or that there's something else I can do to help myself since all but two doctors have dismissed my issues in my 14 years of visits.**     


&amp;#x200B;

**tldr; severe chronic constipation with exceptional pain, don't know how to cope emotionally/physically or advocate for myself, haven't been given enough information on what I've been dealing with. advice/reassurance I'm not going to die when I finally go to the bathroom so I don't hold it in would be appreciated. Or should I just skip all this and head to the ER? Literally anything would help me out right now.** ",Constipation
1494,t3_a4p633,"This is a very personal post but a serious problem, not really sure where else on the internet to post this.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out. I drink a LOT of water daily by the way, at least 6 bottles of 16oz water a day.",Constipation

1. Drink 2-3 table spoons of vegetable oil twice daily.
2. Do this over about 3 days.

I know it's terrible tasting, but it did wonders for me. Completely, unclogged my pipes, and  back on track without taking anything (no prune juice, laxatives Etc...).

1526,t3_9istch,"I'll try to make this as brief as possible. Dealt with hard stools my entire life. Didn't think much of it until I developed hemmoroids in my early 20s to present day at 28. I had a hemmoroidectomy to remove horribly large external ones but internal ones were left untouched due to safety concerns with my surgeon. I also got sick a lot as a kid. 

I used to drink milk constantly. I have now since cut that out mostly and only drink a coffee a day and water. I eat blue berry fiber bars everyday and salad. I've had prune juice, stool softeners, mild laxatives all yielding various to no results. Finally I found super colon cleanse (green bottle) in pill form.  Taking it gave me mad painful stomach cramps and sometimes diaherreha but afterwards I felt so much better. Didn't feel like I had to go the rest of the day. Stopped getting sick, migraines, and other stomach related issues. 

 The bottle says to only take it for 10 days every two months. I tried that and went right back to having a hard time passing anything. So I went back on it. I didn't always take 4 pills a day sometimes only 2 or even none but I went far beyond the 10 days. About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end! I tried the regular colon cleanse (red bottle) by the same company which is just phsylium husk and other stuff but it's not making much of a difference. 

I had X-rays at a medical clinic done a few months ago saying my colon was fine but was very impacted with feces. When I went for this x-ray I was experiencing horrible stomach pain. The super colon cleanse made that pass in combination with quitting milk. However as I stated I am afraid to take that stuff long term and risk damage though I wonder if the damage from a full colon is even worse.

1537,t3_97x6co,"Hey it's me again, I made a post about being constipated some days ago and I wasn't able to pass gas yesterday so I decided to take action today.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out. It continued like a storm and it hurt so fucking bad I could not just stop, the bowel movement was like operating on its own all i could do was control the straining intensity for most part of this traumatic experience. It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax? 
I have my appointment tomorrow so i'll let my GP know but still I'm really shocked/happy but also terrified of this becoming an habit.

The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better.

Here's the story.  I have been overall having some issues with constipation ever since I have been in wellburtin xl (generic) about 3 months ago.  I'm currently on the 300 mg.   This medication has been making me constipated.  I've only really been getting minor issues with it initially so I've been just doing the basics in terms of treating the symptoms.  

This week I have been having hard pebble stools (level 1) on the stool chart starting last Monday.  These defecations were 1 a day but only minor stool was passed.  My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.

1563,t3_8tgg2k,"I’ll preface and say I’m 27 years old and have had minor constipation issues much of my life and then around 12-13 is when it really started to get bad. I was diagnosed with ibs at 16. After I got into a car accident a few years ago my symptoms have been worse than ever. But I have been able to somewhat manage my symptoms with miralax and zofran.


Anyway. I knew I was constipated because when it gets this bad, I can hardly eat, barely have an appetite, and have stabbing pains in my abdomen with lower back pain that comes and goes. I still poop, but have trouble emptying myself out, which is a fairly normal issue in my life. I’ve been drinking miralax every night and trying to get myself to pass some stuff. And I’ve been doing pretty well! Pretty solid poops but it still feels like I’m constipated. It totally affects my quality of life. ",Constipation
1564,t3_8t2hhf,"Just want to put this out there, my doctor told me to triple my vitamin D dose 2 weeks ago and it made me really constipated! 

I think this has something to do with reducing the amount of magnesium in the gut, which is used to relax muscles.",Constipation
1565,t3_8szsn2,"A good for mention is part of the title. I've struggled with this issue all my life. I'm 22 (male) and can't figure out why my body refuses to have proper bowl movements if ANY at all.  

**ISSUE:** I get constipation regularly. About half the days in a given month I am constipated. It takes the form of: In ability to pass stool. Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain. Of course this causes stress and a clouded mind/ bad mood whenever I'm like this because who wouldn't be upset when they can't poop? I get pain in the TOP of my stomach, the ascending colon (look down front right part of abdominal area above the pelvis.), and my right side.   

**TYPICAL PERIOD OF CONSTIPATION:**  Anywhere from 7-14 days. ( if it becomes the longer I end up eating soft foods and/or having little hunger.)

**TRIED METHODS:**  Smooth move tea ( worked when I was a kid, not anymore) , Miralax, Olive oil ( works on occasion if things are not too stuck up), Metamucil, changing diet and exercise ( and sticking to it), Increasing liquid intake, increasing fiber from diet, v8, juices, dried fruits, stretching, self massage ( only works if stomach is not tight from pain or distention which it is tight 9/10 times) , PT for corrective breathing/pushing. GI given trial of linzess.

**COLONOSCOPY:** Came back 100&amp;#37; clean. 

**SEEN GI:**  Report told me I suffer from IBS -C ( aka they don't have a root cause) , and he is worried I may develop colon cancer in 10 years from the chronic stress on my colon ( also some adjacent family history of colon cancer.

People. If I'm honest with myself sometimes I think whether life like this is livable. It effects my life in so many ways: mood, outlook on life, whether I go to social events, what I eat, how I sleep ( I get little sleep , I think it's because my body understands something is wrong), basically my stomach determines my life. I'm single but I don't even feel like I'm datable because of the issues I have and how I need to live. I recently discovered Reddit to workshop some issues/ thoughts I have about general life ( games, guitar, car, exercise etc), but maybe now I ask for help on this big question.",Constipation

1567,t3_8sf6e9,"Hi everyone. I have recently trouble in the last month (being constipated for 3 days twice in the last 2 weeks) and now im entering my 3rd day of constipation for the third (badum tss) time. Two days ago, I stayed up all night with friends and I ate nothing but junkfood and stressed a lot. I also gave up smoking cigarettes a month ago and i smoked one that night. I have tried laxatives (Carter's) and lots of fruits (lots of prunes),flax seeds, nuts and even prune nectar/warm water. Today I was really bloated and nauseaous as hell and could'nt really move so I didn't move a lot. I feel like it's so hard to even push. I could only let small farts rarely. Now is this a side effect of laxatives or is it impaction? Kinda worried right now but i'll drink lemon juice with baking soda when waking up and if it does not work then i'll try the enema. Take in not i might have an hemorroid and I am really scared of anal prolapse/tearing so I kind of subconsciouly hold it in.

1570,t3_8qc6sp,"I have suffered from chronic constipation my whole life. Doctors do not seem to think it is an issue that I have to use natural laxative agents to go - if I do not take these I can go up to 2 weeks without having a single bowel movement. I have tried so many things, I am at a loss - I increase my fibre, and it seems to make my constipation even worse. I take probiotics and magnesium supplements. Literally, the only thing that seems to work is stimulant laxatives (I always take natural ones, but I know long-term use of senna is not good either and can create dependency).

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon. This could very well be the case, but then do I not have any other choice but to take stimulant laxatives for relief?

Does anyone know if constipation could be a sign of specific types of allergies? I want to request allergy testing from my doctor, but wnat to know what I am asking for. I know I will ask for dairy allergy testing, and perhaps gluten as well. 

On a side note, I also have a hormonal imbalance - I am not sure if this could possibly be related to my constipation but I have an excess of androgens in my system (I am female btw) - possible Polycystic Ovarian System (not yet confirmed). I am not overweight, but I have other symptoms such as cystic acne, and infrequent, very light periods.",Constipation
1571,t3_8mwkcq,"I taking sunflower lecithin or Kre-Alkalyn creatine powder triggered the chronic constipation, but I believe it was the sunflower lecithin. The constipation lasted for about 3 months. Lost the urge to go, when I did go, bowel movements were very very weak and only a small amount would come. I had very little ""sensation"", it wouldn't have that ""good"" feeling, it was as if I had become numb in a way. Stool was sticky and very small. I figured it would resolve itself as I have had similar experiences with certain dairy products in the past, but it didn't. I tried magnesium, flax seed, probiotic, vitamin C, water, etc. Searched around on google to try and figure out what was going on, came across these posts:

https://www.curezone.org/forums/fm.asp?i=2240328

I tried DGL and after two days I started to notice some sensation had returned, the movements were a bit stronger, and more was coming. As the days went on, the urge to go became stronger. Before I was really ""listening"" for the slightest indication I needed to go, but after starting DGL I began to notice I had strong enough urges that I had to drop whatever I was doing and go to the rest room.
Now I'm feeling pretty good, maybe 90%, enough to say I feel pretty much back to normal.

Just wanted to put this out there for others to try.

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

This is the DGL I use, I take one in the morning on an empty stomatch with water, coffee an hour later. I usually fast in the morning, I only drink straight coffee, nothing added. Licorice interferes with blood clotting drugs, make sure to read about other contraindications.

Naturally I spent a lot of time reading about constipation and trying different home remedies. Here's what I've settled on.

(1) Drink coffee before eating breakfast. I never used to drink coffee but I gave it a try and it seems to help.

(2) Gradually increased the amount of fiber I eat. Most fruits and vegetables don't contain enough fiber to make it worth eating them. Seriously, look up the number of grams of fiber per 100 grams of apple or celery; it's not worth the trouble of chewing them and swallowing them!

Split peas and lentils, which are very easy to cook, contain a worthwhile amount of fiber. And chia seeds, of course. A tablespoon of chia seeds in 4 tablespoons of warm water forms a disgusting glop that is chock full of healthy fiber.

(3) Take a magnesium supplement. Some days I take magnesium citrate capsules, other days I dissolve half a teaspoon of epsom salt (which is magnesium sulfate) in water and chug it down.

(4) I reduced my consumption of bananas, cheese, and calcium-based antacids (Tums). I read that they have a ""binding"" effect on some people.

I am a 19 year old female. 
I have been constipated since the 31st of December. It was a Saturday night. The last thing I ate that night was a takeaway pizza. Now, usually after eating pizza I get diarrhoea, so I was curious the next morning when I realised the food didn't exit my body. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, I bought Ducolax laxatives and they worked their magic on my bowels within 4 hours. I took another pill on Thursday as I had ate a lot of food that week and my bowels didn't seem to be working on their own. The pill didn't work. I took another laxative on Friday which didn't work also. 

I bought Milk of Magnesia, which is magnesium hydroxide, and it worked on the Saturday of that week. I drank 6 5 ml cups of the milk last night and I've had diarrhoea 4 times since then. Diarrhoea is a side effect of the milk. I examined my stool and it was paper thin and had ragged edges, does that make sense? It looked like pieces of ripped toilet paper. 
I have been smelling a foul odor in my mouth, but I brush my teeth many times a day and I am drinking lots of water. I think it is the food rotting inside my body.

Have you ever experienced difficulty in passing your bowels? Almost everyone goes through this at some point in their lives. Being constipated is not a very serious issue but it can be discomforting if it happens often.

When a person has bowel movements less than three times a week or if you have pain or strain while passing your daily motion, you could be suffering from constipation.

While there are no “right” number of times you out to move your bowels, medical experts say it you should pass motion at least once a day.

The most common symptoms of constipation are:

You suffer from bloating or abdominal cramps
Movement of bowels requires a lot of strain
Hard or small stools
You have to depend on laxatives or special food such as yogurt, cereals packed with fiber or oatmeal, juices etcetera
Constipation is usually caused by a number of factors, some of them are:

Low water intake
Lack of fibrous food in the diet
Lack of physical exercise
Over dose of laxatives
There are many ways to avoid constipation in both adults and kids. Here, we list out a few home remedies for constipation or certain treatments that you can perform by yourself to help cure constipation.

Include high fibre food in your diet.
Fibrous food prevents your stools from becoming hard. They help in adding bulk in your motion. When you start adding fibrous food in your diet, ensure you do so little by little as your digestive system will need to get used to it. Some examples of fibrous food are split peas, lentils, black beans, avocado, bran flakes, whole wheat pasta, pearled barley, oatmeal.
Increase water intake.
One well known method to prevent constipation is to liquid forms of food such as soups and juices in one’s diet. Movement of bowels is easier as the stool becomes bulky and softer because of the increased fluid in the colon. Medical experts recommend an adult drinks 2 liters of water a day.
Regular physical exercise.
Doctors recommend that individuals exercise at least 30 minutes every day. Regular exercise enhances blood flow and keeps the various organs active thereby improving digestion.
Keeping these tips in mind, you can prevent constipation. There are many supplements that will help you add fibre into your diet.

1632,t3_bnhb70,"Hi! Hoping y'all may be able to help me. I'm 25/M and I've never had constipation issues before.  I get anxiety semi-easily so I'm hoping one of you friendly folks can help me ease my worries. &lt;333

Basically, I've only had small pebbles / small pencil-shaped BMs for around 8 or 9 days now. No sizable BMs. I was very dehydrated and eating horribly when this started (an anomaly for me) which almost certainly triggered it, so I've been drinking 3 liters of water and eating much much healthier every day since.

I went to a GI doctor 4 days ago and he told me to take Miralax once daily and to supplement with Metamucil if I want, which I've been doing. It hasn't really helped as far as I can tell. I'm not in pain, just mild discomfort, but I'm a little worried and want to nip this in the bud. Today is day 8, and I took a full dose (30ml) of Milk of Magnesia this morning and it only resulted in a few small bursts of green powdery-looking diarrhea — which I sense may be the Metamucil fiber mixed with the green chlorophyll of all the vegetables I'm eating. Now I've just inserted a glycerin suppository 30 minutes ago but I'm not really feeling anything at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a programmer, I'm at my desk monday to friday. I lift weights 3 times a week for 1.5 hours each time. I drink at least 2 liters of water per day, I drink coffee, I eat veggies and I eat spicy food. I've had pretty bad constipation issues for the past 3.5 years (taking a shit one day per week, often by using senna). I've tried a ton of things, including huge amounts of fiber supplements, fibrous foods and  PEG 3350. Nothing worked for more than two weeks. I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

It's the ONLY thing that changed during that time. I don't know the science that could explain why I don't have issues anymore. The only thing there is is that my lower back stays perpendicular to the ground for a longer period per day than before.",Constipation

I haven't pooped in like 2.5 weeks and things got real bad real quick, I started losing my appetite, I couldn't eat at all and even if I ate, I'd puke it right away. my poo started to leak while the hard bit wouldn't come out. when I realized how bad things got, I started to go to the toilet but, no joy. I'd spend hours in there just to get a little bit of it out, with indescribable pain.

I'm having a lot of fiber in my diet, I was having small pieces get stuck in my lower rectum weeks to months ago causing immense pain and discomfort when sitting. Since taking more fiber / changing my diet a little bit more I've taken care of a lot of that, but now It seems stuck a little higher up the rectum, about 4 inches in and I have to manually pull it out (as gross as it sounds) in order to relieve some of the pain.

It is also causing me extreme discomfort / lower back pain that  I've never had before.

Also. I'm young, 27, 6'0, 170 lbs, and run / exercise 4+ times a week.

1647,t3_bip1wz,"I began a strict caloric restriction in Sept 2018 and by Jan 2019 had lost around 11kg. When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

Having monitored BM everyday for the past 3 weeks or so, I can see that: for the first week once per 4 day period was typical, but during the past two weeks there was only one day without a BM. Boluses are consistently Bristol 4, minimal discomfort, sense of completion of evacuation is consistently in the 85% + range, and total size is generally large (20 to 30 cm length).

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.  I'm going to try psyllium here soon when I get to the store next but what could possibly be CAUSING this resistance to anything that could soften things up back there?  It's getting to be a little ridiculous, doing everything I can and still tearing open my fissure every.  Damn.  Morning.  Because I can't soften my stools.  


OH and edit:  I went to my PCP's office about a month ago and she seemed completely resistant to any other options for me other than surgery to heal just the fissure and could offer no real suggestions other than referring me to a surgeon.

My doctor keeps telling me to use fiber and miralax, with occasional senna, but fiber makes me bloated and even more backed up. I do think it's a motility issue since stuff isn't even reaching my rectum, but obviously I can't use senna every day (I don't want to develop a dependency on it).

1681,t3_ayfsfm,"Several minutes after waking up, I felt the need to poop.
After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

1682,t3_aydf7f,"Last week I thought I hurt my back which isn’t unusual for me. It finally hurt so bad that Saturday I went to a chiro because that was the only place open and I just wanted to feel better. Found out that I was constipated. So I went and got some magnesium citrate because i had this happen once about 15 years ago and that’s what they recommended. It helped a little bit but I noticed that I still hadn’t gone to the bathroom two days after I used it. 

On Tuesday my mom had to end up taking me to the ER because my back hurt so bad I thought I was gonna die. While waiting on the drs, my sciatic nerves started to hurt. I mean intense pain from my lower back down both legs, all the way to my toes. The drs came back said I was severely constipated still and let me choose between lactulose or what they give people for colonoscopies. I chose the lactulose because I didn’t want to drink 2 gallons of anything. It seemed to work for a little bit. I’m supposed to take 10ml 3 times a day. After my first dose I went and started clearing out well. Back pain was still there but not as bad. I only took one dose that night because it was late when I got home. 

I took my first dose of the day yesterday, but the second dose all together, and went a little more. The sciatic pain was still reeling it’s head. I’m talking can’t take more than 5 steps before I have to sit, feel like my bones are all breaking, kind of pain. Here we are, two days later, I’ve taken one days worth of full doses, and a dose this morning and I still haven’t gone beyond my second dose. And the pain is getting worse. I don’t know what to do.

When away from home I don't get the urge to defecate at all.  It's not that I have to go and hold it, I just don't have any urge at all.  I usually go about an hour and a half after eating breakfast.  The problem is that I usually eat and and leave for work about 30 minutes later, meaning I don't get to go all day, and maybe the urge doesn't come at home that evening.  Maybe it lasts another day or two.  It's torture.

Recently, I had a friend visit my house.  While he was here, I didn't get the urge at all.  As soon as I dropped him off at the airport and came home, I got the urge within about 10 minutes.  It doesn't make any sense, but it must be deeply rooted psychologically. People I have talked to don't understand at all, and simply claim that it doesn't make sense because having to go is just a physical response, and if you have to go, you go, whenever or wherever.

1696,t3_am3srl,"The following are natural remedies for constipation that at first may seem too simple to work, but I’m sure one of these will work for you. 

You will notice a recurring theme here, which is that your bowels are more likely to move first thing in the morning and many of the remedies necessitate you employ them first thing in the morning. 

Feel free to try more than one in the same day, or you can try one at a time. 

1. Drink 1-2 liters of water in a short time span. And then go for a walk. 

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

It had never gotten too bad because since about 2nd grade I’ve been on adhd medicine which most of them are stimulants so they have helped keep me regular. But recently, I’ve went to the dr for stomach and side pain, which I assumed was either my ovarian cysts or my kidney cyst which I recently gotten diagnosed with, but the doctor said that they shouldn’t really be causing me pain. So I got an ultrasound and they said that I had mild constipation and told me to take a laxative. Instead I just ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a fiber bar and waited, which helped me finally go to the bathroom. I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up? Anyways I’m going to the bathroom everyday again but only with my adhd medicine and I still don’t go as much as I usually do, I’m trying to incorporate fiber bars into my diet and just improve my diet overall because it’s not the best. But the reason I asked this is because when I talked to my grandmother about it she said it is probably just ibs but idk because it’s not like I have diarrhea sometimes and constpation others, it’s more like I’m usually constipated. Also colon issues run in my family, my mom passed away from colon cancer, my grandmothers brother passed away from diverticulitis because it went untreated, and her other brother also passed away from colon cancer. So I don’t know if this could be related to something like that. It just stresses me out. I havnt been to the dr for this specifically and I don’t know if I should. I’m really lost on what I should do so if anyone has any advice that would be really helpful.",Constipation

1726,t3_a50mkk,"Hi all, my history is similar to a post just posted here funny enough, although I have only existed for 20 years, so I only have a 14 year history. Sorry, this is really long, and partially a vent post. please tell me if there is a more appropriate sub for this!

&amp;#x200B;

  
Since I was 6, I've had issues with constipation; I cannot remember a time in my life where I have not had to worry about it. Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help. Or does senna take most of that away? **I know you guys are not doctors, or a substitute, but I need reassurance it'll be ok, or that there's something else I can do to help myself since all but two doctors have dismissed my issues in my 14 years of visits.**     


&amp;#x200B;

**tldr; severe chronic constipation with exceptional pain, don't know how to cope emotionally/physically or advocate for myself, haven't been given enough information on what I've been dealing with. advice/reassurance I'm not going to die when I finally go to the bathroom so I don't hold it in would be appreciated. Or should I just skip all this and head to the ER? Literally anything would help me out right now.** ",Constipation
1727,t3_a4p633,"This is a very personal post but a serious problem, not really sure where else on the internet to post this.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out. I drink a LOT of water daily by the way, at least 6 bottles of 16oz water a day.",Constipation
1728,t3_a3w1b1,"It’s been about a week and a half where I haven’t had a good BM. I’ve only been passing small, hard pebbles and straining a lot :( at first I tried prunelax as I thought something gentle would do me good but only pebbles the next day still. Next, I tried Miralax as I thought that was a strong choice but only pebbles still. I’m now on day 2 of miralax but it wasn’t doing anything so I also took a Dulcolax suppository today. This of course stimulated some bowel movement but it was just getting out hard pebbles still! And that’s where I am now, still feeling the effects of Dulcolax but not really pooping much more. Could it be it was just the pebbles that needed to come out? Will the Dulcolax still do more? It’s been 3 hours now and no real BM have occurred. What should I do? Any advice?

I just feel like I can’t go the way I used to anymore. The bloating is sometimes uncomfortable. Usually,I would eat a banana every morning and that would help with bowel movements a little, but now I’m finding that they’re not working as well as they did a week ago.

However, I've noticed that I now seem to have a constant mild-moderate lower back pain, directly in the middle of my back above my tailbone area.

I had a hemmoroidectomy to remove horribly large external ones but internal ones were left untouched due to safety concerns with my surgeon. I also got sick a lot as a kid. 

I used to drink milk constantly. I have now since cut that out mostly and only drink a coffee a day and water. I eat blue berry fiber bars everyday and salad. I've had prune juice, stool softeners, mild laxatives all yielding various to no results. Finally I found super colon cleanse (green bottle) in pill form.  Taking it gave me mad painful stomach cramps and sometimes diaherreha but afterwards I felt so much better. Didn't feel like I had to go the rest of the day. Stopped getting sick, migraines, and other stomach related issues. 

 The bottle says to only take it for 10 days every two months. I tried that and went right back to having a hard time passing anything. So I went back on it. I didn't always take 4 pills a day sometimes only 2 or even none but I went far beyond the 10 days. About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end! I tried the regular colon cleanse (red bottle) by the same company which is just phsylium husk and other stuff but it's not making much of a difference.

I began taking fiber to force this shit out, and it worked - although not in satisfactory amounts. 

This has now been my life for the last few months, forcing incomplete bowel movements with fucking fiber. I have an appointment with a gastro doc next month if I make it till then - but I have a hunch I'll need to see a colo-rectal.
The sudden change happened after a wild night.

 *Sex stuff ahead* 

I went to what I'll call a 'party' except it was very little drinking and lots and lots of sex. The men were well endowed, and it was an 'intense' night. I think it fucked up my sigmoid. 

I just really needed to vent and put this out there, because I've been fucking miserable... Bloated, unpredictable movements, insufficient amounts of shit. It's been awful. I'm so glad that this sub exists... I haven't been able to talk to anyone about this :(

I started drinking about 80 oz a day about three days ago and taking miralax at night. The miralax isn't something I want to rely on but I'm just hoping it'll Kickstart my digestive tract while the water starts working it's magic. So far drinking all this water has been okay. I've seen some areas improve but not in the toilet department. I'm so bloated and uncomfortable but everything I've read says that's pretty normal and that my body's just retaining the water.

I know you shouldn't strain, but I had to pass this thing and eventually it passed like a drain being unblocked with a huge and soft stool behind it. I felt faint and drained, almost like I would pass out.

Only one before about 5 years ago have I had anything similar and that was only about 50% of this. I can't face going though this again.

1770,t3_97x6co,"Hey it's me again, I made a post about being constipated some days ago and I wasn't able to pass gas yesterday so I decided to take action today.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out. It continued like a storm and it hurt so fucking bad I could not just stop, the bowel movement was like operating on its own all i could do was control the straining intensity for most part of this traumatic experience. It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax? 
I have my appointment tomorrow so i'll let my GP know but still I'm really shocked/happy but also terrified of this becoming an habit.

1775,t3_949taj,"This is happened to me twice in one year, and I'm wondering if its because I have chronic constipation issues. The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better. The next day I was week and exhausted, but felt way better.

Now I thought maybe this had been caused by food poisoning or something, but I'm now wondering if my body is purging itself after being so constipated for so long. 

Has this happened to anyone else out there? Does your body eventually just say, I need a deep cleaning, and put you through this hell?

1779,t3_934n6z,"Today, I went to the ER for severe constipation.  Sounds strange right?  

Here's the story.  I have been overall having some issues with constipation ever since I have been in wellburtin xl (generic) about 3 months ago.  I'm currently on the 300 mg.   This medication has been making me constipated.  I've only really been getting minor issues with it initially so I've been just doing the basics in terms of treating the symptoms.  

This week I have been having hard pebble stools (level 1) on the stool chart starting last Monday.  These defecations were 1 a day but only minor stool was passed.  My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.

Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain.

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon.

I tried DGL and after two days I started to notice some sensation had returned, the movements were a bit stronger, and more was coming. As the days went on, the urge to go became stronger. Before I was really ""listening"" for the slightest indication I needed to go, but after starting DGL I began to notice I had strong enough urges that I had to drop whatever I was doing and go to the rest room.
Now I'm feeling pretty good, maybe 90%, enough to say I feel pretty much back to normal.

Just wanted to put this out there for others to try.

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

This is the DGL I use, I take one in the morning on an empty stomatch with water, coffee an hour later. I usually fast in the morning, I only drink straight coffee, nothing added. Licorice interferes with blood clotting drugs, make sure to read about other contraindications.

Naturally I spent a lot of time reading about constipation and trying different home remedies. Here's what I've settled on.

(1) Drink coffee before eating breakfast. I never used to drink coffee but I gave it a try and it seems to help.

(2) Gradually increased the amount of fiber I eat. Most fruits and vegetables don't contain enough fiber to make it worth eating them. Seriously, look up the number of grams of fiber per 100 grams of apple or celery; it's not worth the trouble of chewing them and swallowing them!

Split peas and lentils, which are very easy to cook, contain a worthwhile amount of fiber. And chia seeds, of course. A tablespoon of chia seeds in 4 tablespoons of warm water forms a disgusting glop that is chock full of healthy fiber.

(3) Take a magnesium supplement. Some days I take magnesium citrate capsules, other days I dissolve half a teaspoon of epsom salt (which is magnesium sulfate) in water and chug it down.

(4) I reduced my consumption of bananas, cheese, and calcium-based antacids (Tums). I read that they have a ""binding"" effect on some people.

I am a 19 year old female. 
I have been constipated since the 31st of December. It was a Saturday night. The last thing I ate that night was a takeaway pizza. Now, usually after eating pizza I get diarrhoea, so I was curious the next morning when I realised the food didn't exit my body. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, I bought Ducolax laxatives and they worked their magic on my bowels within 4 hours. I took another pill on Thursday as I had ate a lot of food that week and my bowels didn't seem to be working on their own. The pill didn't work. I took another laxative on Friday which didn't work also. 

I bought Milk of Magnesia, which is magnesium hydroxide, and it worked on the Saturday of that week. I drank 6 5 ml cups of the milk last night and I've had diarrhoea 4 times since then. Diarrhoea is a side effect of the milk. I examined my stool and it was paper thin and had ragged edges, does that make sense? It looked like pieces of ripped toilet paper. 
I have been smelling a foul odor in my mouth, but I brush my teeth many times a day and I am drinking lots of water. I think it is the food rotting inside my body.

Have you ever experienced difficulty in passing your bowels? Almost everyone goes through this at some point in their lives. Being constipated is not a very serious issue but it can be discomforting if it happens often.

When a person has bowel movements less than three times a week or if you have pain or strain while passing your daily motion, you could be suffering from constipation.

While there are no “right” number of times you out to move your bowels, medical experts say it you should pass motion at least once a day.

The most common symptoms of constipation are:

You suffer from bloating or abdominal cramps
Movement of bowels requires a lot of strain
Hard or small stools
You have to depend on laxatives or special food such as yogurt, cereals packed with fiber or oatmeal, juices etcetera
Constipation is usually caused by a number of factors, some of them are:

Low water intake
Lack of fibrous food in the diet
Lack of physical exercise
Over dose of laxatives
There are many ways to avoid constipation in both adults and kids. Here, we list out a few home remedies for constipation or certain treatments that you can perform by yourself to help cure constipation.

Include high fibre food in your diet.
Fibrous food prevents your stools from becoming hard. They help in adding bulk in your motion. When you start adding fibrous food in your diet, ensure you do so little by little as your digestive system will need to get used to it. Some examples of fibrous food are split peas, lentils, black beans, avocado, bran flakes, whole wheat pasta, pearled barley, oatmeal.
Increase water intake.
One well known method to prevent constipation is to liquid forms of food such as soups and juices in one’s diet. Movement of bowels is easier as the stool becomes bulky and softer because of the increased fluid in the colon. Medical experts recommend an adult drinks 2 liters of water a day.
Regular physical exercise.
Doctors recommend that individuals exercise at least 30 minutes every day. Regular exercise enhances blood flow and keeps the various organs active thereby improving digestion.
Keeping these tips in mind, you can prevent constipation. There are many supplements that will help you add fibre into your diet.

I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

It's the ONLY thing that changed during that time. I don't know the science that could explain why I don't have issues anymore. The only thing there is is that my lower back stays perpendicular to the ground for a longer period per day than before.",Constipation

To start off I am 17 y/o, and I haven't been a regular pooper for as long as I remember, I just want to share my story today because before it happened I never thought that I'll make it out of this. 

Basically, this may be a little fucked up but I like holding my poo in, I know. I haven't pooped in like 2.5 weeks and things got real bad real quick, I started losing my appetite, I couldn't eat at all and even if I ate, I'd puke it right away. my poo started to leak while the hard bit wouldn't come out. when I realized how bad things got, I started to go to the toilet but, no joy. I'd spend hours in there just to get a little bit of it out, with indescribable pain.

I have tried macrogol 4000, sodium picosulfate, nothing worked at all until this morning, I told my mother to take me to the doctor and I told him all about this, he prescribed docusate sodium, the ones that you administer rectally, and thank god it worked. 

I feel so much better now though I don't think I have defecated completely, I'm planning on going in again tonight to try to fully empty my stomach. 

I just wanted to share my story for all of you to have a little hope, I never thought I'd make it out and here I am, things get better.

I'm having a lot of fiber in my diet, I was having small pieces get stuck in my lower rectum weeks to months ago causing immense pain and discomfort when sitting. Since taking more fiber / changing my diet a little bit more I've taken care of a lot of that, but now It seems stuck a little higher up the rectum, about 4 inches in and I have to manually pull it out (as gross as it sounds) in order to relieve some of the pain.

It is also causing me extreme discomfort / lower back pain that  I've never had before.

Also. I'm young, 27, 6'0, 170 lbs, and run / exercise 4+ times a week. 

I've taken  citrucel which just bulks it but still it gets stuck. I had a colonoscopy the dr only found a polyp, 2cm and small hemmroids which he doesn't think is the issue at all.

1880,t3_bip1wz,"I began a strict caloric restriction in Sept 2018 and by Jan 2019 had lost around 11kg. When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

Having monitored BM everyday for the past 3 weeks or so, I can see that: for the first week once per 4 day period was typical, but during the past two weeks there was only one day without a BM. Boluses are consistently Bristol 4, minimal discomfort, sense of completion of evacuation is consistently in the 85% + range, and total size is generally large (20 to 30 cm length).

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.

After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

I chose the lactulose because I didn’t want to drink 2 gallons of anything. It seemed to work for a little bit. I’m supposed to take 10ml 3 times a day. After my first dose I went and started clearing out well. Back pain was still there but not as bad. I only took one dose that night because it was late when I got home. 

I took my first dose of the day yesterday, but the second dose all together, and went a little more. The sciatic pain was still reeling it’s head. I’m talking can’t take more than 5 steps before I have to sit, feel like my bones are all breaking, kind of pain.

1919,t3_awvsdb,"I haven't had much luck finding anyone else who has this, but it caused me a problem my whole life.

When away from home I don't get the urge to defecate at all.  It's not that I have to go and hold it, I just don't have any urge at all.  I usually go about an hour and a half after eating breakfast.  The problem is that I usually eat and and leave for work about 30 minutes later, meaning I don't get to go all day, and maybe the urge doesn't come at home that evening.  Maybe it lasts another day or two.  It's torture.

Recently, I had a friend visit my house.  While he was here, I didn't get the urge at all.  As soon as I dropped him off at the airport and came home, I got the urge within about 10 minutes.  It doesn't make any sense, but it must be deeply rooted psychologically. People I have talked to don't understand at all, and simply claim that it doesn't make sense because having to go is just a physical response, and if you have to go, you go, whenever or wherever.

I'm amazed at people who defecate in public restrooms. I want to, but don't get the urge away from home.

1929,t3_am3srl,"The following are natural remedies for constipation that at first may seem too simple to work, but I’m sure one of these will work for you. 

You will notice a recurring theme here, which is that your bowels are more likely to move first thing in the morning and many of the remedies necessitate you employ them first thing in the morning. 

Feel free to try more than one in the same day, or you can try one at a time. 

1. Drink 1-2 liters of water in a short time span. And then go for a walk. 

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

* I started drinking twice as much water and that absolutely helped.
* I make sure to walk enough each day. 
* I took a laxative in hopes that I could break up any blockages a month ago. That seemed to get things moving.  It was only on one occasion, but it seemed effective.
* Eat less sugar. 
* I also started making my own bread. Nothing fancy, just some homemade wheat bread and white bread. That has made a big difference! I eat bread everyday at breakfast. I'm not sure if its the fiber increase, or maybe eliminating some preservatives  from my diet that are in store-bought bread, but I haven't had an issue since.

It had never gotten too bad because since about 2nd grade I’ve been on adhd medicine which most of them are stimulants so they have helped keep me regular. But recently, I’ve went to the dr for stomach and side pain, which I assumed was either my ovarian cysts or my kidney cyst which I recently gotten diagnosed with, but the doctor said that they shouldn’t really be causing me pain. So I got an ultrasound and they said that I had mild constipation and told me to take a laxative. Instead I just ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a fiber bar and waited, which helped me finally go to the bathroom. I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up?

&amp;#x200B;

  
Since I was 6, I've had issues with constipation; I cannot remember a time in my life where I have not had to worry about it. Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help. Or does senna take most of that away? **I know you guys are not doctors, or a substitute, but I need reassurance it'll be ok, or that there's something else I can do to help myself since all but two doctors have dismissed my issues in my 14 years of visits.**     


&amp;#x200B;

**tldr; severe chronic constipation with exceptional pain, don't know how to cope emotionally/physically or advocate for myself, haven't been given enough information on what I've been dealing with. advice/reassurance I'm not going to die when I finally go to the bathroom so I don't hold it in would be appreciated.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out. I drink a LOT of water daily by the way, at least 6 bottles of 16oz water a day.",Constipation
1961,t3_a3w1b1,"It’s been about a week and a half where I haven’t had a good BM. I’ve only been passing small, hard pebbles and straining a lot :( at first I tried prunelax as I thought something gentle would do me good but only pebbles the next day still. Next, I tried Miralax as I thought that was a strong choice but only pebbles still. I’m now on day 2 of miralax but it wasn’t doing anything so I also took a Dulcolax suppository today. This of course stimulated some bowel movement but it was just getting out hard pebbles still! And that’s where I am now, still feeling the effects of Dulcolax but not really pooping much more. Could it be it was just the pebbles that needed to come out? Will the Dulcolax still do more? It’s been 3 hours now and no real BM have occurred. What should I do? Any advice?

I just feel like I can’t go the way I used to anymore. The bloating is sometimes uncomfortable. Usually,I would eat a banana every morning and that would help with bowel movements a little, but now I’m finding that they’re not working as well as they did a week ago.

Over the last couple of weeks it has been greatly reduced, once per day, sometimes skipping a day, straining to go, etc. I tried Miralax and it seemed to help somewhat. I read an article by a GI doctor and it recommended sesame seeds and psyllium. Both of these have greatly helped, my appetite is better, and I just feel better overall. However, I've noticed that I now seem to have a constant mild-moderate lower back pain, directly in the middle of my back above my tailbone area.

I had a hemmoroidectomy to remove horribly large external ones but internal ones were left untouched due to safety concerns with my surgeon. I also got sick a lot as a kid. 

I used to drink milk constantly. I have now since cut that out mostly and only drink a coffee a day and water. I eat blue berry fiber bars everyday and salad. I've had prune juice, stool softeners, mild laxatives all yielding various to no results. Finally I found super colon cleanse (green bottle) in pill form.  Taking it gave me mad painful stomach cramps and sometimes diaherreha but afterwards I felt so much better. Didn't feel like I had to go the rest of the day. Stopped getting sick, migraines, and other stomach related issues. 

 The bottle says to only take it for 10 days every two months. I tried that and went right back to having a hard time passing anything. So I went back on it. I didn't always take 4 pills a day sometimes only 2 or even none but I went far beyond the 10 days. About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end! I tried the regular colon cleanse (red bottle) by the same company which is just phsylium husk and other stuff but it's not making much of a difference. 

I had X-rays at a medical clinic done a few months ago saying my colon was fine but was very impacted with feces. When I went for this x-ray I was experiencing horrible stomach pain.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out. It continued like a storm and it hurt so fucking bad I could not just stop, the bowel movement was like operating on its own all i could do was control the straining intensity for most part of this traumatic experience. It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax?

2008,t3_949taj,"This is happened to me twice in one year, and I'm wondering if its because I have chronic constipation issues. The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better. The next day I was week and exhausted, but felt way better.

Now I thought maybe this had been caused by food poisoning or something, but I'm now wondering if my body is purging itself after being so constipated for so long. 

Has this happened to anyone else out there? Does your body eventually just say, I need a deep cleaning, and put you through this hell?

2012,t3_934n6z,"Today, I went to the ER for severe constipation.  Sounds strange right?  

Here's the story.  I have been overall having some issues with constipation ever since I have been in wellburtin xl (generic) about 3 months ago.  I'm currently on the 300 mg.   This medication has been making me constipated.  I've only really been getting minor issues with it initially so I've been just doing the basics in terms of treating the symptoms.  

This week I have been having hard pebble stools (level 1) on the stool chart starting last Monday.  These defecations were 1 a day but only minor stool was passed.  My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.

**ISSUE:** I get constipation regularly. About half the days in a given month I am constipated. It takes the form of: In ability to pass stool. Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain. Of course this causes stress and a clouded mind/ bad mood whenever I'm like this because who wouldn't be upset when they can't poop? I get pain in the TOP of my stomach, the ascending colon (look down front right part of abdominal area above the pelvis.), and my right side.   

**TYPICAL PERIOD OF CONSTIPATION:**  Anywhere from 7-14 days. ( if it becomes the longer I end up eating soft foods and/or having little hunger.)

**TRIED METHODS:**  Smooth move tea ( worked when I was a kid, not anymore) , Miralax, Olive oil ( works on occasion if things are not too stuck up), Metamucil, changing diet and exercise ( and sticking to it), Increasing liquid intake, increasing fiber from diet, v8, juices, dried fruits, stretching, self massage ( only works if stomach is not tight from pain or distention which it is tight 9/10 times) , PT for corrective breathing/pushing. GI given trial of linzess.

**COLONOSCOPY:** Came back 100&amp;#37; clean.

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon. This could very well be the case, but then do I not have any other choice but to take stimulant laxatives for relief?

I tried DGL and after two days I started to notice some sensation had returned, the movements were a bit stronger, and more was coming. As the days went on, the urge to go became stronger. Before I was really ""listening"" for the slightest indication I needed to go, but after starting DGL I began to notice I had strong enough urges that I had to drop whatever I was doing and go to the rest room.
Now I'm feeling pretty good, maybe 90%, enough to say I feel pretty much back to normal.

Just wanted to put this out there for others to try.

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

Naturally I spent a lot of time reading about constipation and trying different home remedies. Here's what I've settled on.

(1) Drink coffee before eating breakfast. I never used to drink coffee but I gave it a try and it seems to help.

(2) Gradually increased the amount of fiber I eat. Most fruits and vegetables don't contain enough fiber to make it worth eating them. Seriously, look up the number of grams of fiber per 100 grams of apple or celery; it's not worth the trouble of chewing them and swallowing them!

Split peas and lentils, which are very easy to cook, contain a worthwhile amount of fiber. And chia seeds, of course. A tablespoon of chia seeds in 4 tablespoons of warm water forms a disgusting glop that is chock full of healthy fiber.

(3) Take a magnesium supplement. Some days I take magnesium citrate capsules, other days I dissolve half a teaspoon of epsom salt (which is magnesium sulfate) in water and chug it down.

(4) I reduced my consumption of bananas, cheese, and calcium-based antacids (Tums). I read that they have a ""binding"" effect on some people.

I am a 19 year old female. 
I have been constipated since the 31st of December. It was a Saturday night. The last thing I ate that night was a takeaway pizza. Now, usually after eating pizza I get diarrhoea, so I was curious the next morning when I realised the food didn't exit my body. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, I bought Ducolax laxatives and they worked their magic on my bowels within 4 hours. I took another pill on Thursday as I had ate a lot of food that week and my bowels didn't seem to be working on their own. The pill didn't work. I took another laxative on Friday which didn't work also. 

I bought Milk of Magnesia, which is magnesium hydroxide, and it worked on the Saturday of that week. I drank 6 5 ml cups of the milk last night and I've had diarrhoea 4 times since then. Diarrhoea is a side effect of the milk. I examined my stool and it was paper thin and had ragged edges, does that make sense? It looked like pieces of ripped toilet paper. 
I have been smelling a foul odor in my mouth, but I brush my teeth many times a day and I am drinking lots of water. I think it is the food rotting inside my body. 
Does anyone have any suggestions for what could be wrong?

Have you ever experienced difficulty in passing your bowels? Almost everyone goes through this at some point in their lives. Being constipated is not a very serious issue but it can be discomforting if it happens often.

When a person has bowel movements less than three times a week or if you have pain or strain while passing your daily motion, you could be suffering from constipation.

While there are no “right” number of times you out to move your bowels, medical experts say it you should pass motion at least once a day.

The most common symptoms of constipation are:

You suffer from bloating or abdominal cramps
Movement of bowels requires a lot of strain
Hard or small stools
You have to depend on laxatives or special food such as yogurt, cereals packed with fiber or oatmeal, juices etcetera
Constipation is usually caused by a number of factors, some of them are:

Low water intake
Lack of fibrous food in the diet
Lack of physical exercise
Over dose of laxatives
There are many ways to avoid constipation in both adults and kids. Here, we list out a few home remedies for constipation or certain treatments that you can perform by yourself to help cure constipation.

Include high fibre food in your diet.
Fibrous food prevents your stools from becoming hard. They help in adding bulk in your motion. When you start adding fibrous food in your diet, ensure you do so little by little as your digestive system will need to get used to it. Some examples of fibrous food are split peas, lentils, black beans, avocado, bran flakes, whole wheat pasta, pearled barley, oatmeal.
Increase water intake.
One well known method to prevent constipation is to liquid forms of food such as soups and juices in one’s diet. Movement of bowels is easier as the stool becomes bulky and softer because of the increased fluid in the colon. Medical experts recommend an adult drinks 2 liters of water a day.
Regular physical exercise.
Doctors recommend that individuals exercise at least 30 minutes every day. Regular exercise enhances blood flow and keeps the various organs active thereby improving digestion.
Keeping these tips in mind, you can prevent constipation. There are many supplements that will help you add fibre into your diet.

No sizable BMs. I was very dehydrated and eating horribly when this started (an anomaly for me) which almost certainly triggered it, so I've been drinking 3 liters of water and eating much much healthier every day since.

Today is day 8, and I took a full dose (30ml) of Milk of Magnesia this morning and it only resulted in a few small bursts of green powdery-looking diarrhea — which I sense may be the Metamucil fiber mixed with the green chlorophyll of all the vegetables I'm eating. Now I've just inserted a glycerin suppository 30 minutes ago but I'm not really feeling anything at all.

I drink at least 2 liters of water per day, I drink coffee, I eat veggies and I eat spicy food. I've had pretty bad constipation issues for the past 3.5 years (taking a shit one day per week, often by using senna). I've tried a ton of things, including huge amounts of fiber supplements, fibrous foods and  PEG 3350. Nothing worked for more than two weeks. I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

Having monitored BM everyday for the past 3 weeks or so, I can see that: for the first week once per 4 day period was typical, but during the past two weeks there was only one day without a BM.

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.  I'm going to try psyllium here soon when I get to the store next but what could possibly be CAUSING this resistance to anything that could soften things up back there?  It's getting to be a little ridiculous, doing everything I can and still tearing open my fissure every.  Damn.  Morning.  Because I can't soften my stools.  


OH and edit:  I went to my PCP's office about a month ago and she seemed completely resistant to any other options for me other than surgery to heal just the fissure and could offer no real suggestions other than referring me to a surgeon.  This is something I am going to avoid as long as possible because I'm certain the reason I'm not healing is because my ass just refuses to pass anything but rock hard lumps.

After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

We have arranged a meeting kinda thing for like a week and we came to this friend's house which is 6-7 hours of driving away from our houses. So I'm stuck here, in this tiny apartment which i don't even feel comfy. And besides the comfort, the kitchen is 2 steps away from the toilet and also the living area is like 5 steps and the only room is just next to the toilet. Meaning, you will be not even 4 metres away from your friends when you're taking a sh*t. And I am so tired of this that im writing a post about it, I hated it. So much

I've tried Colace and it didn't really do much so I stopped taking it all together. (Why pay for something that doesn't work?) 

My main question is, should I be concerned? 

My doctor wasn't exactly... Helpful. She suggested Miralax, which I am in the middle of trying, and said she would percribe something if that didnt help. In the back of my mind I am wondering if something more serious could be going on. She ordered an x-ray and an ultrasound which came back normal, besides showing I was constipated (surprise!) She doesn't exactly seem confident in any of her suggestions which kind of makes me loose confidence too. I'm wondering if I should be trying to go to a specialist. ",Constipation

* I started drinking twice as much water and that absolutely helped.
* I make sure to walk enough each day. 
* I took a laxative in hopes that I could break up any blockages a month ago. That seemed to get things moving.  It was only on one occasion, but it seemed effective.
* Eat less sugar. 
* I also started making my own bread. Nothing fancy, just some homemade wheat bread and white bread. That has made a big difference! I eat bread everyday at breakfast. I'm not sure if its the fiber increase, or maybe eliminating some preservatives  from my diet that are in store-bought bread, but I haven't had an issue since. I attribute a lot of my relief to making my own bread.

I realized that even though its whole wheat with fiber, the bread ITSELF was the one causing the majority of my chronic constipation. I stopped intaking bread.. or at least limiting it substantially to the point where after 4 to 5 months I've been mainly constipated free with normal bowel movements. Occasional constipation, but I've managed to be able to go daily. I can even ingest a lot of cheese now crazy enough.

2188,t3_a8vvm9,"Soo I’m 15 years old and for as long as I can remember I’ve had trouble with constipation. It had never gotten too bad because since about 2nd grade I’ve been on adhd medicine which most of them are stimulants so they have helped keep me regular. But recently, I’ve went to the dr for stomach and side pain, which I assumed was either my ovarian cysts or my kidney cyst which I recently gotten diagnosed with, but the doctor said that they shouldn’t really be causing me pain. So I got an ultrasound and they said that I had mild constipation and told me to take a laxative. Instead I just ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a fiber bar and waited, which helped me finally go to the bathroom. I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up? Anyways I’m going to the bathroom everyday again but only with my adhd medicine and I still don’t go as much as I usually do, I’m trying to incorporate fiber bars into my diet and just improve my diet overall because it’s not the best. But the reason I asked this is because when I talked to my grandmother about it she said it is probably just ibs but idk because it’s not like I have diarrhea sometimes and constpation others, it’s more like I’m usually constipated. Also colon issues run in my family, my mom passed away from colon cancer, my grandmothers brother passed away from diverticulitis because it went untreated, and her other brother also passed away from colon cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Since I was 6, I've had issues with constipation; I cannot remember a time in my life where I have not had to worry about it. Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help. Or does senna take most of that away? **I know you guys are not doctors, or a substitute, but I need reassurance it'll be ok, or that there's something else I can do to help myself since all but two doctors have dismissed my issues in my 14 years of visits.**     


&amp;#x200B;

**tldr; severe chronic constipation with exceptional pain, don't know how to cope emotionally/physically or advocate for myself, haven't been given enough information on what I've been dealing with. advice/reassurance I'm not going to die when I finally go to the bathroom so I don't hold it in would be appreciated. Or should I just skip all this and head to the ER? Literally anything would help me out right now.** ",Constipation
2193,t3_a4p633,"This is a very personal post but a serious problem, not really sure where else on the internet to post this.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out.

The only reasons why I think this happened was that I was eating a lot if great food that was home cooked, as well as almost walking 7 miles a day around the festival grounds. My husband also felt this. 

Usually when I travel it’s the opposite!!

Is it really as simple as avoiding processed foods and exercising? Or is there something in the water in New Orleans?

 I was also drinking a ton of iced tea and wine which is usually constipating! So I was very confused!

I had a hemmoroidectomy to remove horribly large external ones but internal ones were left untouched due to safety concerns with my surgeon. I also got sick a lot as a kid. 

I used to drink milk constantly. I have now since cut that out mostly and only drink a coffee a day and water. I eat blue berry fiber bars everyday and salad. I've had prune juice, stool softeners, mild laxatives all yielding various to no results. Finally I found super colon cleanse (green bottle) in pill form.  Taking it gave me mad painful stomach cramps and sometimes diaherreha but afterwards I felt so much better. Didn't feel like I had to go the rest of the day. Stopped getting sick, migraines, and other stomach related issues. 

 The bottle says to only take it for 10 days every two months. I tried that and went right back to having a hard time passing anything. So I went back on it. I didn't always take 4 pills a day sometimes only 2 or even none but I went far beyond the 10 days. About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end! I tried the regular colon cleanse (red bottle) by the same company which is just phsylium husk and other stuff but it's not making much of a difference. 

I had X-rays at a medical clinic done a few months ago saying my colon was fine but was very impacted with feces. When I went for this x-ray I was experiencing horrible stomach pain. The super colon cleanse made that pass in combination with quitting milk. However as I stated I am afraid to take that stuff long term and risk damage though I wonder if the damage from a full colon is even worse.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out. It continued like a storm and it hurt so fucking bad I could not just stop, the bowel movement was like operating on its own all i could do was control the straining intensity for most part of this traumatic experience. It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax?

The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better. The next day I was week and exhausted, but felt way better.

Now I thought maybe this had been caused by food poisoning or something, but I'm now wondering if my body is purging itself after being so constipated for so long.

My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.  

Is it possible to rip your rectum or rupture during a massive stool/constipation?

**ISSUE:** I get constipation regularly. About half the days in a given month I am constipated. It takes the form of: In ability to pass stool. Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain. Of course this causes stress and a clouded mind/ bad mood whenever I'm like this because who wouldn't be upset when they can't poop? I get pain in the TOP of my stomach, the ascending colon (look down front right part of abdominal area above the pelvis.), and my right side.   

**TYPICAL PERIOD OF CONSTIPATION:**  Anywhere from 7-14 days. ( if it becomes the longer I end up eating soft foods and/or having little hunger.)

**TRIED METHODS:**  Smooth move tea ( worked when I was a kid, not anymore) , Miralax, Olive oil ( works on occasion if things are not too stuck up), Metamucil, changing diet and exercise ( and sticking to it), Increasing liquid intake, increasing fiber from diet, v8, juices, dried fruits, stretching, self massage ( only works if stomach is not tight from pain or distention which it is tight 9/10 times) , PT for corrective breathing/pushing. GI given trial of linzess.

**COLONOSCOPY:** Came back 100&amp;#37; clean. 

**SEEN GI:**  Report told me I suffer from IBS -C ( aka they don't have a root cause) , and he is worried I may develop colon cancer in 10 years from the chronic stress on my colon ( also some adjacent family history of colon cancer.

People. If I'm honest with myself sometimes I think whether life like this is livable. It effects my life in so many ways: mood, outlook on life, whether I go to social events, what I eat, how I sleep ( I get little sleep , I think it's because my body understands something is wrong), basically my stomach determines my life.

Doctors do not seem to think it is an issue that I have to use natural laxative agents to go - if I do not take these I can go up to 2 weeks without having a single bowel movement. I have tried so many things, I am at a loss - I increase my fibre, and it seems to make my constipation even worse. I take probiotics and magnesium supplements. Literally, the only thing that seems to work is stimulant laxatives (I always take natural ones, but I know long-term use of senna is not good either and can create dependency).

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon. This could very well be the case, but then do I not have any other choice but to take stimulant laxatives for relief?

Does anyone know if constipation could be a sign of specific types of allergies? I want to request allergy testing from my doctor, but wnat to know what I am asking for. I know I will ask for dairy allergy testing, and perhaps gluten as well. 

On a side note, I also have a hormonal imbalance - I am not sure if this could possibly be related to my constipation but I have an excess of androgens in my system (I am female btw) - possible Polycystic Ovarian System (not yet confirmed).

I had very little ""sensation"", it wouldn't have that ""good"" feeling, it was as if I had become numb in a way. Stool was sticky and very small. I figured it would resolve itself as I have had similar experiences with certain dairy products in the past, but it didn't.

I tried DGL and after two days I started to notice some sensation had returned, the movements were a bit stronger, and more was coming. As the days went on, the urge to go became stronger. Before I was really ""listening"" for the slightest indication I needed to go, but after starting DGL I began to notice I had strong enough urges that I had to drop whatever I was doing and go to the rest room.
Now I'm feeling pretty good, maybe 90%, enough to say I feel pretty much back to normal.

Just wanted to put this out there for others to try.

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

This is the DGL I use, I take one in the morning on an empty stomatch with water, coffee an hour later. I usually fast in the morning, I only drink straight coffee, nothing added. Licorice interferes with blood clotting drugs, make sure to read about other contraindications.

Naturally I spent a lot of time reading about constipation and trying different home remedies. Here's what I've settled on.

(1) Drink coffee before eating breakfast. I never used to drink coffee but I gave it a try and it seems to help.

(2) Gradually increased the amount of fiber I eat. Most fruits and vegetables don't contain enough fiber to make it worth eating them. Seriously, look up the number of grams of fiber per 100 grams of apple or celery; it's not worth the trouble of chewing them and swallowing them!

Split peas and lentils, which are very easy to cook, contain a worthwhile amount of fiber. And chia seeds, of course. A tablespoon of chia seeds in 4 tablespoons of warm water forms a disgusting glop that is chock full of healthy fiber.

(3) Take a magnesium supplement. Some days I take magnesium citrate capsules, other days I dissolve half a teaspoon of epsom salt (which is magnesium sulfate) in water and chug it down.

(4) I reduced my consumption of bananas, cheese, and calcium-based antacids (Tums). I read that they have a ""binding"" effect on some people.

2310,t3_5nmxg6,"Hello, 
I am a 19 year old female. 
I have been constipated since the 31st of December. It was a Saturday night. The last thing I ate that night was a takeaway pizza. Now, usually after eating pizza I get diarrhoea, so I was curious the next morning when I realised the food didn't exit my body. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, I bought Ducolax laxatives and they worked their magic on my bowels within 4 hours. I took another pill on Thursday as I had ate a lot of food that week and my bowels didn't seem to be working on their own. The pill didn't work. I took another laxative on Friday which didn't work also. 

I bought Milk of Magnesia, which is magnesium hydroxide, and it worked on the Saturday of that week. I drank 6 5 ml cups of the milk last night and I've had diarrhoea 4 times since then. Diarrhoea is a side effect of the milk. I examined my stool and it was paper thin and had ragged edges, does that make sense? It looked like pieces of ripped toilet paper. 
I have been smelling a foul odor in my mouth, but I brush my teeth many times a day and I am drinking lots of water. I think it is the food rotting inside my body. 
Does anyone have any suggestions for what could be wrong?

Have you ever experienced difficulty in passing your bowels? Almost everyone goes through this at some point in their lives. Being constipated is not a very serious issue but it can be discomforting if it happens often.

When a person has bowel movements less than three times a week or if you have pain or strain while passing your daily motion, you could be suffering from constipation.

While there are no “right” number of times you out to move your bowels, medical experts say it you should pass motion at least once a day.

The most common symptoms of constipation are:

You suffer from bloating or abdominal cramps
Movement of bowels requires a lot of strain
Hard or small stools
You have to depend on laxatives or special food such as yogurt, cereals packed with fiber or oatmeal, juices etcetera
Constipation is usually caused by a number of factors, some of them are:

Low water intake
Lack of fibrous food in the diet
Lack of physical exercise
Over dose of laxatives
There are many ways to avoid constipation in both adults and kids. Here, we list out a few home remedies for constipation or certain treatments that you can perform by yourself to help cure constipation.

Include high fibre food in your diet.
Fibrous food prevents your stools from becoming hard. They help in adding bulk in your motion. When you start adding fibrous food in your diet, ensure you do so little by little as your digestive system will need to get used to it. Some examples of fibrous food are split peas, lentils, black beans, avocado, bran flakes, whole wheat pasta, pearled barley, oatmeal.
Increase water intake.
One well known method to prevent constipation is to liquid forms of food such as soups and juices in one’s diet. Movement of bowels is easier as the stool becomes bulky and softer because of the increased fluid in the colon. Medical experts recommend an adult drinks 2 liters of water a day.
Regular physical exercise.
Doctors recommend that individuals exercise at least 30 minutes every day. Regular exercise enhances blood flow and keeps the various organs active thereby improving digestion.
Keeping these tips in mind, you can prevent constipation. There are many supplements that will help you add fibre into your diet.

Basically, I've only had small pebbles / small pencil-shaped BMs for around 8 or 9 days now. No sizable BMs. I was very dehydrated and eating horribly when this started (an anomaly for me) which almost certainly triggered it, so I've been drinking 3 liters of water and eating much much healthier every day since.

I went to a GI doctor 4 days ago and he told me to take Miralax once daily and to supplement with Metamucil if I want, which I've been doing. It hasn't really helped as far as I can tell. I'm not in pain, just mild discomfort, but I'm a little worried and want to nip this in the bud. Today is day 8, and I took a full dose (30ml) of Milk of Magnesia this morning and it only resulted in a few small bursts of green powdery-looking diarrhea — which I sense may be the Metamucil fiber mixed with the green chlorophyll of all the vegetables I'm eating. Now I've just inserted a glycerin suppository 30 minutes ago but I'm not really feeling anything at all.

I'm a programmer, I'm at my desk monday to friday. I lift weights 3 times a week for 1.5 hours each time. I drink at least 2 liters of water per day, I drink coffee, I eat veggies and I eat spicy food. I've had pretty bad constipation issues for the past 3.5 years (taking a shit one day per week, often by using senna). I've tried a ton of things, including huge amounts of fiber supplements, fibrous foods and  PEG 3350. Nothing worked for more than two weeks. I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

2367,t3_b6s95d,"Enjoy my throwaway username lol

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.  I'm going to try psyllium here soon when I get to the store next but what could possibly be CAUSING this resistance to anything that could soften things up back there?  It's getting to be a little ridiculous, doing everything I can and still tearing open my fissure every.  Damn.  Morning.  Because I can't soften my stools.  


OH and edit:  I went to my PCP's office about a month ago and she seemed completely resistant to any other options for me other than surgery to heal just the fissure and could offer no real suggestions other than referring me to a surgeon.  This is something I am going to avoid as long as possible because I'm certain the reason I'm not healing is because my ass just refuses to pass anything but rock hard lumps.

2380,t3_ayfsfm,"Several minutes after waking up, I felt the need to poop.
After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

It finally hurt so bad that Saturday I went to a chiro because that was the only place open and I just wanted to feel better. Found out that I was constipated. So I went and got some magnesium citrate because i had this happen once about 15 years ago and that’s what they recommended. It helped a little bit but I noticed that I still hadn’t gone to the bathroom two days after I used it. 

On Tuesday my mom had to end up taking me to the ER because my back hurt so bad I thought I was gonna die. While waiting on the drs, my sciatic nerves started to hurt. I mean intense pain from my lower back down both legs, all the way to my toes. The drs came back said I was severely constipated still and let me choose between lactulose or what they give people for colonoscopies. I chose the lactulose because I didn’t want to drink 2 gallons of anything. It seemed to work for a little bit. I’m supposed to take 10ml 3 times a day. After my first dose I went and started clearing out well. Back pain was still there but not as bad. I only took one dose that night because it was late when I got home. 

I took my first dose of the day yesterday, but the second dose all together, and went a little more. The sciatic pain was still reeling it’s head. I’m talking can’t take more than 5 steps before I have to sit, feel like my bones are all breaking, kind of pain.

I usually go about an hour and a half after eating breakfast.  The problem is that I usually eat and and leave for work about 30 minutes later, meaning I don't get to go all day, and maybe the urge doesn't come at home that evening.  Maybe it lasts another day or two.  It's torture.

People I have talked to don't understand at all, and simply claim that it doesn't make sense because having to go is just a physical response, and if you have to go, you go, whenever or wherever.

2395,t3_am3srl,"The following are natural remedies for constipation that at first may seem too simple to work, but I’m sure one of these will work for you. 

You will notice a recurring theme here, which is that your bowels are more likely to move first thing in the morning and many of the remedies necessitate you employ them first thing in the morning. 

Feel free to try more than one in the same day, or you can try one at a time. 

1. Drink 1-2 liters of water in a short time span. And then go for a walk. 

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

2409,t3_agrk6x,"I am 21 years old (M). For my entire childhood I didn't have a problem pooping. I would do it every 3-4 days. Maximum 5 days. But about 2 years ago, I started noticing something different. It hurt a lot to relieve myself and I'd have to strain to get the shit out. And it came out a little dry. I didn't really see it as a problem and just got through it. I should also mention that since I was a child, whenever I had the urge to go, I held it back until I couldn't. I thought that this was something that was just a normal thing to do. Anyway for two years, I just went through the pain and dry poop (it happened irregularly. Somedays I went to poop without any pain or strain). However a month ago, something changed. I went an entire week and a half without pooping. And I could feel my stomach getting bigger, like there was a load on it, but I just didn't have the urge to go. When I went to the doctor, he simply gave simple laxative medicine and some diet advice, however a month has gone by and I cannot poop naturally. I take laxatives to go, and when I do, it still hurts and I have had blood come out. I can only go once a week or ten days, and again I can't do it naturally.

Today, **15** days straight that haven't take a shit.

I took a **lactulose syrup** (mild laxative) called **Duphalac** for 3 days straight, created some minor movement but still no number 2 except a few tiny turds which it was a torture to get them out, two days ago.

My bowel got somewhat ""lazy"" and don't move as it did before, therefore I don't feel the urge to go to the toilet.

Sitting there for 5-10 minutes and nothing happens except peeing like a female.

I fart a lot and it smells like **death**.

I'm at the point where i don't want to eat and i feel like i wanna puke because i'm **full of shit**. (no pun intended)

Went to the doctor, got an X-ray and he told me: ""you're full of shit"", advised me to keep taking the lactulose till it works or get an enema from the pharmacy. (Bought one but I really want this as a **last resort**)

My **diet** is well **balanced**,  I'm drinking a lot of water, hot tea and coffee, prunes, fibers etc.

I have accepted that it is the way my body works and I am not trying to change it. It would be different if I experienced some case of serious impaction, then I would look for some remedy and changes in my diet to make my bowel movements softer and more frequent.

2421,t3_a8vvm9,"Soo I’m 15 years old and for as long as I can remember I’ve had trouble with constipation. It had never gotten too bad because since about 2nd grade I’ve been on adhd medicine which most of them are stimulants so they have helped keep me regular. But recently, I’ve went to the dr for stomach and side pain, which I assumed was either my ovarian cysts or my kidney cyst which I recently gotten diagnosed with, but the doctor said that they shouldn’t really be causing me pain. So I got an ultrasound and they said that I had mild constipation and told me to take a laxative. Instead I just ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a fiber bar and waited, which helped me finally go to the bathroom. I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up? Anyways I’m going to the bathroom everyday again but only with my adhd medicine and I still don’t go as much as I usually do, I’m trying to incorporate fiber bars into my diet and just improve my diet overall because it’s not the best. But the reason I asked this is because when I talked to my grandmother about it she said it is probably just ibs but idk because it’s not like I have diarrhea sometimes and constpation others, it’s more like I’m usually constipated. Also colon issues run in my family, my mom passed away from colon cancer, my grandmothers brother passed away from diverticulitis because it went untreated, and her other brother also passed away from colon cancer. So I don’t know if this could be related to something like that. It just stresses me out. I havnt been to the dr for this specifically and I don’t know if I should. I’m really lost on what I should do so if anyone has any advice that would be really helpful.",Constipation

&amp;#x200B;

  
Since I was 6, I've had issues with constipation; I cannot remember a time in my life where I have not had to worry about it. Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help. Or does senna take most of that away? **I know you guys are not doctors, or a substitute, but I need reassurance it'll be ok, or that there's something else I can do to help myself since all but two doctors have dismissed my issues in my 14 years of visits.**     


&amp;#x200B;

**tldr; severe chronic constipation with exceptional pain, don't know how to cope emotionally/physically or advocate for myself, haven't been given enough information on what I've been dealing with. advice/reassurance I'm not going to die when I finally go to the bathroom so I don't hold it in would be appreciated. Or should I just skip all this and head to the ER? Literally anything would help me out right now.** ",Constipation
2426,t3_a4p633,"This is a very personal post but a serious problem, not really sure where else on the internet to post this.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out. I drink a LOT of water daily by the way, at least 6 bottles of 16oz water a day.",Constipation

This of course stimulated some bowel movement but it was just getting out hard pebbles still! And that’s where I am now, still feeling the effects of Dulcolax but not really pooping much more.

I could feel stool piling up as far up as my rib-cage. HORRIBLE. It affects every aspect of your body. I then read a method online that will get that backed up stool moving, and unclog the pipes so to speak. Use this method ONLY for the unclogging, and not for daily use!

&amp;#x200B;

1. Drink 2-3 table spoons of vegetable oil twice daily.
2. Do this over about 3 days.

I know it's terrible tasting, but it did wonders for me. Completely, unclogged my pipes, and  back on track without taking anything (no prune juice, laxatives Etc...). It basically serves as a lubricant for the stool. After you are clear and passing normally without drinking veg oil, or any other kind of stimulant, get back on a balanced diet.

2458,t3_9istch,"I'll try to make this as brief as possible. Dealt with hard stools my entire life. Didn't think much of it until I developed hemmoroids in my early 20s to present day at 28. I had a hemmoroidectomy to remove horribly large external ones but internal ones were left untouched due to safety concerns with my surgeon. I also got sick a lot as a kid. 

I used to drink milk constantly. I have now since cut that out mostly and only drink a coffee a day and water. I eat blue berry fiber bars everyday and salad. I've had prune juice, stool softeners, mild laxatives all yielding various to no results. Finally I found super colon cleanse (green bottle) in pill form.  Taking it gave me mad painful stomach cramps and sometimes diaherreha but afterwards I felt so much better. Didn't feel like I had to go the rest of the day. Stopped getting sick, migraines, and other stomach related issues. 

 The bottle says to only take it for 10 days every two months. I tried that and went right back to having a hard time passing anything. So I went back on it. I didn't always take 4 pills a day sometimes only 2 or even none but I went far beyond the 10 days. About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end! I tried the regular colon cleanse (red bottle) by the same company which is just phsylium husk and other stuff but it's not making much of a difference. 

I had X-rays at a medical clinic done a few months ago saying my colon was fine but was very impacted with feces. When I went for this x-ray I was experiencing horrible stomach pain. The super colon cleanse made that pass in combination with quitting milk. However as I stated I am afraid to take that stuff long term and risk damage though I wonder if the damage from a full colon is even worse. 

One last thing. I don't have a primary care doctor and I don't want to see a specialist.

I began taking fiber to force this shit out, and it worked - although not in satisfactory amounts. 

This has now been my life for the last few months, forcing incomplete bowel movements with fucking fiber. I have an appointment with a gastro doc next month if I make it till then - but I have a hunch I'll need to see a colo-rectal.

2469,t3_97x6co,"Hey it's me again, I made a post about being constipated some days ago and I wasn't able to pass gas yesterday so I decided to take action today.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out. It continued like a storm and it hurt so fucking bad I could not just stop, the bowel movement was like operating on its own all i could do was control the straining intensity for most part of this traumatic experience. It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax? 
I have my appointment tomorrow so i'll let my GP know but still I'm really shocked/happy but also terrified of this becoming an habit.

The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better. The next day I was week and exhausted, but felt way better.

Now I thought maybe this had been caused by food poisoning or something, but I'm now wondering if my body is purging itself after being so constipated for so long.

Here's the story.  I have been overall having some issues with constipation ever since I have been in wellburtin xl (generic) about 3 months ago.  I'm currently on the 300 mg.   This medication has been making me constipated.  I've only really been getting minor issues with it initially so I've been just doing the basics in terms of treating the symptoms.  

This week I have been having hard pebble stools (level 1) on the stool chart starting last Monday.  These defecations were 1 a day but only minor stool was passed.  My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.

And I’ve been doing pretty well! Pretty solid poops but it still feels like I’m constipated. It totally affects my quality of life. ",Constipation

**ISSUE:** I get constipation regularly. About half the days in a given month I am constipated. It takes the form of: In ability to pass stool. Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain. Of course this causes stress and a clouded mind/ bad mood whenever I'm like this because who wouldn't be upset when they can't poop? I get pain in the TOP of my stomach, the ascending colon (look down front right part of abdominal area above the pelvis.), and my right side.   

**TYPICAL PERIOD OF CONSTIPATION:**  Anywhere from 7-14 days. ( if it becomes the longer I end up eating soft foods and/or having little hunger.)

**TRIED METHODS:**  Smooth move tea ( worked when I was a kid, not anymore) , Miralax, Olive oil ( works on occasion if things are not too stuck up), Metamucil, changing diet and exercise ( and sticking to it), Increasing liquid intake, increasing fiber from diet, v8, juices, dried fruits, stretching, self massage ( only works if stomach is not tight from pain or distention which it is tight 9/10 times) , PT for corrective breathing/pushing. GI given trial of linzess.

**COLONOSCOPY:** Came back 100&amp;#37; clean. 

**SEEN GI:**  Report told me I suffer from IBS -C ( aka they don't have a root cause) , and he is worried I may develop colon cancer in 10 years from the chronic stress on my colon ( also some adjacent family history of colon cancer.

People. If I'm honest with myself sometimes I think whether life like this is livable. It effects my life in so many ways: mood, outlook on life, whether I go to social events, what I eat, how I sleep ( I get little sleep , I think it's because my body understands something is wrong), basically my stomach determines my life. I'm single but I don't even feel like I'm datable because of the issues I have and how I need to live.

Doctors do not seem to think it is an issue that I have to use natural laxative agents to go - if I do not take these I can go up to 2 weeks without having a single bowel movement. I have tried so many things, I am at a loss - I increase my fibre, and it seems to make my constipation even worse. I take probiotics and magnesium supplements. Literally, the only thing that seems to work is stimulant laxatives (I always take natural ones, but I know long-term use of senna is not good either and can create dependency).

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon. This could very well be the case, but then do I not have any other choice but to take stimulant laxatives for relief?

Does anyone know if constipation could be a sign of specific types of allergies? I want to request allergy testing from my doctor, but wnat to know what I am asking for. I know I will ask for dairy allergy testing, and perhaps gluten as well. 

On a side note, I also have a hormonal imbalance - I am not sure if this could possibly be related to my constipation but I have an excess of androgens in my system (I am female btw) - possible Polycystic Ovarian System (not yet confirmed).

I figured it would resolve itself as I have had similar experiences with certain dairy products in the past, but it didn't.

I tried DGL and after two days I started to notice some sensation had returned, the movements were a bit stronger, and more was coming. As the days went on, the urge to go became stronger. Before I was really ""listening"" for the slightest indication I needed to go, but after starting DGL I began to notice I had strong enough urges that I had to drop whatever I was doing and go to the rest room.
Now I'm feeling pretty good, maybe 90%, enough to say I feel pretty much back to normal.

Just wanted to put this out there for others to try.

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

This is the DGL I use, I take one in the morning on an empty stomatch with water, coffee an hour later. I usually fast in the morning, I only drink straight coffee, nothing added. Licorice interferes with blood clotting drugs, make sure to read about other contraindications.

Naturally I spent a lot of time reading about constipation and trying different home remedies. Here's what I've settled on.

(1) Drink coffee before eating breakfast. I never used to drink coffee but I gave it a try and it seems to help.

(2) Gradually increased the amount of fiber I eat. Most fruits and vegetables don't contain enough fiber to make it worth eating them. Seriously, look up the number of grams of fiber per 100 grams of apple or celery; it's not worth the trouble of chewing them and swallowing them!

Split peas and lentils, which are very easy to cook, contain a worthwhile amount of fiber. And chia seeds, of course. A tablespoon of chia seeds in 4 tablespoons of warm water forms a disgusting glop that is chock full of healthy fiber.

(3) Take a magnesium supplement. Some days I take magnesium citrate capsules, other days I dissolve half a teaspoon of epsom salt (which is magnesium sulfate) in water and chug it down.

(4) I reduced my consumption of bananas, cheese, and calcium-based antacids (Tums). I read that they have a ""binding"" effect on some people.

I have been constipated since the 31st of December. It was a Saturday night. The last thing I ate that night was a takeaway pizza. Now, usually after eating pizza I get diarrhoea, so I was curious the next morning when I realised the food didn't exit my body. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, I bought Ducolax laxatives and they worked their magic on my bowels within 4 hours. I took another pill on Thursday as I had ate a lot of food that week and my bowels didn't seem to be working on their own. The pill didn't work. I took another laxative on Friday which didn't work also. 

I bought Milk of Magnesia, which is magnesium hydroxide, and it worked on the Saturday of that week. I drank 6 5 ml cups of the milk last night and I've had diarrhoea 4 times since then. Diarrhoea is a side effect of the milk. I examined my stool and it was paper thin and had ragged edges, does that make sense? It looked like pieces of ripped toilet paper. 
I have been smelling a foul odor in my mouth, but I brush my teeth many times a day and I am drinking lots of water. I think it is the food rotting inside my body.

Have you ever experienced difficulty in passing your bowels? Almost everyone goes through this at some point in their lives. Being constipated is not a very serious issue but it can be discomforting if it happens often.

When a person has bowel movements less than three times a week or if you have pain or strain while passing your daily motion, you could be suffering from constipation.

While there are no “right” number of times you out to move your bowels, medical experts say it you should pass motion at least once a day.

The most common symptoms of constipation are:

You suffer from bloating or abdominal cramps
Movement of bowels requires a lot of strain
Hard or small stools
You have to depend on laxatives or special food such as yogurt, cereals packed with fiber or oatmeal, juices etcetera
Constipation is usually caused by a number of factors, some of them are:

Low water intake
Lack of fibrous food in the diet
Lack of physical exercise
Over dose of laxatives
There are many ways to avoid constipation in both adults and kids. Here, we list out a few home remedies for constipation or certain treatments that you can perform by yourself to help cure constipation.

Include high fibre food in your diet.
Fibrous food prevents your stools from becoming hard. They help in adding bulk in your motion. When you start adding fibrous food in your diet, ensure you do so little by little as your digestive system will need to get used to it. Some examples of fibrous food are split peas, lentils, black beans, avocado, bran flakes, whole wheat pasta, pearled barley, oatmeal.
Increase water intake.
One well known method to prevent constipation is to liquid forms of food such as soups and juices in one’s diet. Movement of bowels is easier as the stool becomes bulky and softer because of the increased fluid in the colon. Medical experts recommend an adult drinks 2 liters of water a day.
Regular physical exercise.
Doctors recommend that individuals exercise at least 30 minutes every day. Regular exercise enhances blood flow and keeps the various organs active thereby improving digestion.
Keeping these tips in mind, you can prevent constipation. There are many supplements that will help you add fibre into your diet.

2564,t3_bnhb70,"Hi! Hoping y'all may be able to help me. I'm 25/M and I've never had constipation issues before.  I get anxiety semi-easily so I'm hoping one of you friendly folks can help me ease my worries. &lt;333

Basically, I've only had small pebbles / small pencil-shaped BMs for around 8 or 9 days now. No sizable BMs. I was very dehydrated and eating horribly when this started (an anomaly for me) which almost certainly triggered it, so I've been drinking 3 liters of water and eating much much healthier every day since.

I went to a GI doctor 4 days ago and he told me to take Miralax once daily and to supplement with Metamucil if I want, which I've been doing. It hasn't really helped as far as I can tell. I'm not in pain, just mild discomfort, but I'm a little worried and want to nip this in the bud. Today is day 8, and I took a full dose (30ml) of Milk of Magnesia this morning and it only resulted in a few small bursts of green powdery-looking diarrhea — which I sense may be the Metamucil fiber mixed with the green chlorophyll of all the vegetables I'm eating. Now I've just inserted a glycerin suppository 30 minutes ago but I'm not really feeling anything at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a programmer, I'm at my desk monday to friday. I lift weights 3 times a week for 1.5 hours each time. I drink at least 2 liters of water per day, I drink coffee, I eat veggies and I eat spicy food. I've had pretty bad constipation issues for the past 3.5 years (taking a shit one day per week, often by using senna). I've tried a ton of things, including huge amounts of fiber supplements, fibrous foods and  PEG 3350. Nothing worked for more than two weeks. I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

It's the ONLY thing that changed during that time. I don't know the science that could explain why I don't have issues anymore. The only thing there is is that my lower back stays perpendicular to the ground for a longer period per day than before.",Constipation

I haven't pooped in like 2.5 weeks and things got real bad real quick, I started losing my appetite, I couldn't eat at all and even if I ate, I'd puke it right away. my poo started to leak while the hard bit wouldn't come out. when I realized how bad things got, I started to go to the toilet but, no joy. I'd spend hours in there just to get a little bit of it out, with indescribable pain.

Since taking more fiber / changing my diet a little bit more I've taken care of a lot of that, but now It seems stuck a little higher up the rectum, about 4 inches in and I have to manually pull it out (as gross as it sounds) in order to relieve some of the pain.

Also. I'm young, 27, 6'0, 170 lbs, and run / exercise 4+ times a week.

2579,t3_bip1wz,"I began a strict caloric restriction in Sept 2018 and by Jan 2019 had lost around 11kg. When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

Having monitored BM everyday for the past 3 weeks or so, I can see that: for the first week once per 4 day period was typical, but during the past two weeks there was only one day without a BM. Boluses are consistently Bristol 4, minimal discomfort, sense of completion of evacuation is consistently in the 85% + range, and total size is generally large (20 to 30 cm length).

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.  I'm going to try psyllium here soon when I get to the store next but what could possibly be CAUSING this resistance to anything that could soften things up back there?  It's getting to be a little ridiculous, doing everything I can and still tearing open my fissure every.  Damn.  Morning.  Because I can't soften my stools.  


OH and edit:  I went to my PCP's office about a month ago and she seemed completely resistant to any other options for me other than surgery to heal just the fissure and could offer no real suggestions other than referring me to a surgeon.

I cut out *most* alcohol, started counting macros, and focused on a committment to get to the CF box at least 5 days a week.

2613,t3_ayfsfm,"Several minutes after waking up, I felt the need to poop.
After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

2614,t3_aydf7f,"Last week I thought I hurt my back which isn’t unusual for me. It finally hurt so bad that Saturday I went to a chiro because that was the only place open and I just wanted to feel better. Found out that I was constipated. So I went and got some magnesium citrate because i had this happen once about 15 years ago and that’s what they recommended. It helped a little bit but I noticed that I still hadn’t gone to the bathroom two days after I used it. 

On Tuesday my mom had to end up taking me to the ER because my back hurt so bad I thought I was gonna die. While waiting on the drs, my sciatic nerves started to hurt. I mean intense pain from my lower back down both legs, all the way to my toes. The drs came back said I was severely constipated still and let me choose between lactulose or what they give people for colonoscopies. I chose the lactulose because I didn’t want to drink 2 gallons of anything. It seemed to work for a little bit. I’m supposed to take 10ml 3 times a day. After my first dose I went and started clearing out well. Back pain was still there but not as bad. I only took one dose that night because it was late when I got home. 

I took my first dose of the day yesterday, but the second dose all together, and went a little more. The sciatic pain was still reeling it’s head. I’m talking can’t take more than 5 steps before I have to sit, feel like my bones are all breaking, kind of pain. Here we are, two days later, I’ve taken one days worth of full doses, and a dose this morning and I still haven’t gone beyond my second dose. And the pain is getting worse. I don’t know what to do.

When away from home I don't get the urge to defecate at all.  It's not that I have to go and hold it, I just don't have any urge at all.  I usually go about an hour and a half after eating breakfast.  The problem is that I usually eat and and leave for work about 30 minutes later, meaning I don't get to go all day, and maybe the urge doesn't come at home that evening.  Maybe it lasts another day or two.  It's torture.

Recently, I had a friend visit my house.  While he was here, I didn't get the urge at all.  As soon as I dropped him off at the airport and came home, I got the urge within about 10 minutes.  It doesn't make any sense, but it must be deeply rooted psychologically. People I have talked to don't understand at all, and simply claim that it doesn't make sense because having to go is just a physical response, and if you have to go, you go, whenever or wherever.

I'm amazed at people who defecate in public restrooms. I want to, but don't get the urge away from home.

2628,t3_am3srl,"The following are natural remedies for constipation that at first may seem too simple to work, but I’m sure one of these will work for you. 

You will notice a recurring theme here, which is that your bowels are more likely to move first thing in the morning and many of the remedies necessitate you employ them first thing in the morning. 

Feel free to try more than one in the same day, or you can try one at a time. 

1. Drink 1-2 liters of water in a short time span. And then go for a walk. 

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

* I started drinking twice as much water and that absolutely helped.

* I took a laxative in hopes that I could break up any blockages a month ago. That seemed to get things moving.  It was only on one occasion, but it seemed effective.
* Eat less sugar. 
* I also started making my own bread. Nothing fancy, just some homemade wheat bread and white bread. That has made a big difference! I eat bread everyday at breakfast.

I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up? Anyways I’m going to the bathroom everyday again but only with my adhd medicine and I still don’t go as much as I usually do, I’m trying to incorporate fiber bars into my diet and just improve my diet overall because it’s not the best. But the reason I asked this is because when I talked to my grandmother about it she said it is probably just ibs but idk because it’s not like I have diarrhea sometimes and constpation others, it’s more like I’m usually constipated. Also colon issues run in my family, my mom passed away from colon cancer, my grandmothers brother passed away from diverticulitis because it went untreated, and her other brother also passed away from colon cancer. So I don’t know if this could be related to something like that. It just stresses me out. I havnt been to the dr for this specifically and I don’t know if I should. I’m really lost on what I should do so if anyone has any advice that would be really helpful.",Constipation

&amp;#x200B;

  
Since I was 6, I've had issues with constipation; I cannot remember a time in my life where I have not had to worry about it. Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help. Or does senna take most of that away? **I know you guys are not doctors, or a substitute, but I need reassurance it'll be ok, or that there's something else I can do to help myself since all but two doctors have dismissed my issues in my 14 years of visits.**     


&amp;#x200B;

**tldr; severe chronic constipation with exceptional pain, don't know how to cope emotionally/physically or advocate for myself, haven't been given enough information on what I've been dealing with. advice/reassurance I'm not going to die when I finally go to the bathroom so I don't hold it in would be appreciated. Or should I just skip all this and head to the ER? Literally anything would help me out right now.** ",Constipation
2659,t3_a4p633,"This is a very personal post but a serious problem, not really sure where else on the internet to post this.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out. I drink a LOT of water daily by the way, at least 6 bottles of 16oz water a day.",Constipation

Next, I tried Miralax as I thought that was a strong choice but only pebbles still. I’m now on day 2 of miralax but it wasn’t doing anything so I also took a Dulcolax suppository today. This of course stimulated some bowel movement but it was just getting out hard pebbles still! And that’s where I am now, still feeling the effects of Dulcolax but not really pooping much more. Could it be it was just the pebbles that needed to come out? Will the Dulcolax still do more? It’s been 3 hours now and no real BM have occurred. What should I do? Any advice?

I had a hemmoroidectomy to remove horribly large external ones but internal ones were left untouched due to safety concerns with my surgeon. I also got sick a lot as a kid. 

I used to drink milk constantly. I have now since cut that out mostly and only drink a coffee a day and water. I eat blue berry fiber bars everyday and salad. I've had prune juice, stool softeners, mild laxatives all yielding various to no results. Finally I found super colon cleanse (green bottle) in pill form.  Taking it gave me mad painful stomach cramps and sometimes diaherreha but afterwards I felt so much better. Didn't feel like I had to go the rest of the day. Stopped getting sick, migraines, and other stomach related issues. 

 The bottle says to only take it for 10 days every two months. I tried that and went right back to having a hard time passing anything. So I went back on it. I didn't always take 4 pills a day sometimes only 2 or even none but I went far beyond the 10 days. About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end! I tried the regular colon cleanse (red bottle) by the same company which is just phsylium husk and other stuff but it's not making much of a difference.

I went to what I'll call a 'party' except it was very little drinking and lots and lots of sex. The men were well endowed, and it was an 'intense' night. I think it fucked up my sigmoid. 

I just really needed to vent and put this out there, because I've been fucking miserable... Bloated, unpredictable movements, insufficient amounts of shit. It's been awful. I'm so glad that this sub exists... I haven't been able to talk to anyone about this :(

My biggest problem is the constipation, it's been a big reason why I wasn't able to make it this long in the past. So my doctor told me to start drinking a ton of water. I started drinking about 80 oz a day about three days ago and taking miralax at night. The miralax isn't something I want to rely on but I'm just hoping it'll Kickstart my digestive tract while the water starts working it's magic. So far drinking all this water has been okay. I've seen some areas improve but not in the toilet department. I'm so bloated and uncomfortable but everything I've read says that's pretty normal and that my body's just retaining the water. I'm just wondering how long it takes to get my body back to normal. I hate that my system doesn't know how to poop without nicotine. ",Constipation

I know you shouldn't strain, but I had to pass this thing and eventually it passed like a drain being unblocked with a huge and soft stool behind it. I felt faint and drained, almost like I would pass out.

Only one before about 5 years ago have I had anything similar and that was only about 50% of this. I can't face going though this again. I possibly got a little dehydrated yesterday after going cycling for 20 miles is warm(ish) weather. My diet wasn't great but I did have one apple.

2702,t3_97x6co,"Hey it's me again, I made a post about being constipated some days ago and I wasn't able to pass gas yesterday so I decided to take action today.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out. It continued like a storm and it hurt so fucking bad I could not just stop, the bowel movement was like operating on its own all i could do was control the straining intensity for most part of this traumatic experience. It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax? 
I have my appointment tomorrow so i'll let my GP know but still I'm really shocked/happy but also terrified of this becoming an habit.

2707,t3_949taj,"This is happened to me twice in one year, and I'm wondering if its because I have chronic constipation issues. The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better. The next day I was week and exhausted, but felt way better.

Now I thought maybe this had been caused by food poisoning or something, but I'm now wondering if my body is purging itself after being so constipated for so long. 

Has this happened to anyone else out there? Does your body eventually just say, I need a deep cleaning, and put you through this hell?

2711,t3_934n6z,"Today, I went to the ER for severe constipation.  Sounds strange right?  

Here's the story.  I have been overall having some issues with constipation ever since I have been in wellburtin xl (generic) about 3 months ago.  I'm currently on the 300 mg.   This medication has been making me constipated.  I've only really been getting minor issues with it initially so I've been just doing the basics in terms of treating the symptoms.  

This week I have been having hard pebble stools (level 1) on the stool chart starting last Monday.  These defecations were 1 a day but only minor stool was passed.  My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.

Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain.

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon. This could very well be the case, but then do I not have any other choice but to take stimulant laxatives for relief?

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

This is the DGL I use, I take one in the morning on an empty stomatch with water, coffee an hour later. I usually fast in the morning, I only drink straight coffee, nothing added. Licorice interferes with blood clotting drugs, make sure to read about other contraindications.

Naturally I spent a lot of time reading about constipation and trying different home remedies. Here's what I've settled on.

(1) Drink coffee before eating breakfast. I never used to drink coffee but I gave it a try and it seems to help.

(2) Gradually increased the amount of fiber I eat. Most fruits and vegetables don't contain enough fiber to make it worth eating them. Seriously, look up the number of grams of fiber per 100 grams of apple or celery; it's not worth the trouble of chewing them and swallowing them!

Split peas and lentils, which are very easy to cook, contain a worthwhile amount of fiber. And chia seeds, of course. A tablespoon of chia seeds in 4 tablespoons of warm water forms a disgusting glop that is chock full of healthy fiber.

(3) Take a magnesium supplement. Some days I take magnesium citrate capsules, other days I dissolve half a teaspoon of epsom salt (which is magnesium sulfate) in water and chug it down.

(4) I reduced my consumption of bananas, cheese, and calcium-based antacids (Tums). I read that they have a ""binding"" effect on some people.

I am a 19 year old female. 
I have been constipated since the 31st of December. It was a Saturday night. The last thing I ate that night was a takeaway pizza. Now, usually after eating pizza I get diarrhoea, so I was curious the next morning when I realised the food didn't exit my body. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, I bought Ducolax laxatives and they worked their magic on my bowels within 4 hours. I took another pill on Thursday as I had ate a lot of food that week and my bowels didn't seem to be working on their own. The pill didn't work. I took another laxative on Friday which didn't work also. 

I bought Milk of Magnesia, which is magnesium hydroxide, and it worked on the Saturday of that week. I drank 6 5 ml cups of the milk last night and I've had diarrhoea 4 times since then. Diarrhoea is a side effect of the milk. I examined my stool and it was paper thin and had ragged edges, does that make sense? It looked like pieces of ripped toilet paper. 
I have been smelling a foul odor in my mouth, but I brush my teeth many times a day and I am drinking lots of water. I think it is the food rotting inside my body. 
Does anyone have any suggestions for what could be wrong?

Have you ever experienced difficulty in passing your bowels? Almost everyone goes through this at some point in their lives. Being constipated is not a very serious issue but it can be discomforting if it happens often.

When a person has bowel movements less than three times a week or if you have pain or strain while passing your daily motion, you could be suffering from constipation.

While there are no “right” number of times you out to move your bowels, medical experts say it you should pass motion at least once a day.

The most common symptoms of constipation are:

You suffer from bloating or abdominal cramps
Movement of bowels requires a lot of strain
Hard or small stools
You have to depend on laxatives or special food such as yogurt, cereals packed with fiber or oatmeal, juices etcetera
Constipation is usually caused by a number of factors, some of them are:

Low water intake
Lack of fibrous food in the diet
Lack of physical exercise
Over dose of laxatives
There are many ways to avoid constipation in both adults and kids. Here, we list out a few home remedies for constipation or certain treatments that you can perform by yourself to help cure constipation.

Include high fibre food in your diet.
Fibrous food prevents your stools from becoming hard. They help in adding bulk in your motion. When you start adding fibrous food in your diet, ensure you do so little by little as your digestive system will need to get used to it. Some examples of fibrous food are split peas, lentils, black beans, avocado, bran flakes, whole wheat pasta, pearled barley, oatmeal.
Increase water intake.
One well known method to prevent constipation is to liquid forms of food such as soups and juices in one’s diet. Movement of bowels is easier as the stool becomes bulky and softer because of the increased fluid in the colon. Medical experts recommend an adult drinks 2 liters of water a day.
Regular physical exercise.
Doctors recommend that individuals exercise at least 30 minutes every day. Regular exercise enhances blood flow and keeps the various organs active thereby improving digestion.
Keeping these tips in mind, you can prevent constipation. There are many supplements that will help you add fibre into your diet.

I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

To start off I am 17 y/o, and I haven't been a regular pooper for as long as I remember, I just want to share my story today because before it happened I never thought that I'll make it out of this. 

Basically, this may be a little fucked up but I like holding my poo in, I know. I haven't pooped in like 2.5 weeks and things got real bad real quick, I started losing my appetite, I couldn't eat at all and even if I ate, I'd puke it right away. my poo started to leak while the hard bit wouldn't come out. when I realized how bad things got, I started to go to the toilet but, no joy. I'd spend hours in there just to get a little bit of it out, with indescribable pain.

I have tried macrogol 4000, sodium picosulfate, nothing worked at all until this morning, I told my mother to take me to the doctor and I told him all about this, he prescribed docusate sodium, the ones that you administer rectally, and thank god it worked. 

I feel so much better now though I don't think I have defecated completely, I'm planning on going in again tonight to try to fully empty my stomach. 

I just wanted to share my story for all of you to have a little hope, I never thought I'd make it out and here I am, things get better.

I'm having a lot of fiber in my diet, I was having small pieces get stuck in my lower rectum weeks to months ago causing immense pain and discomfort when sitting. Since taking more fiber / changing my diet a little bit more I've taken care of a lot of that, but now It seems stuck a little higher up the rectum, about 4 inches in and I have to manually pull it out (as gross as it sounds) in order to relieve some of the pain.

It is also causing me extreme discomfort / lower back pain that  I've never had before.

Also. I'm young, 27, 6'0, 170 lbs, and run / exercise 4+ times a week. 

I've taken  citrucel which just bulks it but still it gets stuck. I had a colonoscopy the dr only found a polyp, 2cm and small hemmroids which he doesn't think is the issue at all.

2812,t3_bip1wz,"I began a strict caloric restriction in Sept 2018 and by Jan 2019 had lost around 11kg. When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

Having monitored BM everyday for the past 3 weeks or so, I can see that: for the first week once per 4 day period was typical, but during the past two weeks there was only one day without a BM. Boluses are consistently Bristol 4, minimal discomfort, sense of completion of evacuation is consistently in the 85% + range, and total size is generally large (20 to 30 cm length).

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.  I'm going to try psyllium here soon when I get to the store next but what could possibly be CAUSING this resistance to anything that could soften things up back there?  It's getting to be a little ridiculous, doing everything I can and still tearing open my fissure every.  Damn.  Morning.  Because I can't soften my stools.  


OH and edit:  I went to my PCP's office about a month ago and she seemed completely resistant to any other options for me other than surgery to heal just the fissure and could offer no real suggestions other than referring me to a surgeon.

After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

2851,t3_awvsdb,"I haven't had much luck finding anyone else who has this, but it caused me a problem my whole life.

When away from home I don't get the urge to defecate at all.  It's not that I have to go and hold it, I just don't have any urge at all.  I usually go about an hour and a half after eating breakfast.  The problem is that I usually eat and and leave for work about 30 minutes later, meaning I don't get to go all day, and maybe the urge doesn't come at home that evening.  Maybe it lasts another day or two.  It's torture.

Recently, I had a friend visit my house.  While he was here, I didn't get the urge at all.  As soon as I dropped him off at the airport and came home, I got the urge within about 10 minutes.  It doesn't make any sense, but it must be deeply rooted psychologically. People I have talked to don't understand at all, and simply claim that it doesn't make sense because having to go is just a physical response, and if you have to go, you go, whenever or wherever.

I'm amazed at people who defecate in public restrooms. I want to, but don't get the urge away from home.

I do run 4 days a week and eat pretty healthy- vegetables, fruit, etc.  Anyone else have this problem?  Anyone solved it?

It's as though my poop is just sitting there at the end of my intestine and not able to all go out. Main issue of this being that my bottom is a poop crayon. Meaning after I poop and between poops if i wipe it is poop on the wipe. I have wasted a visit to the doctor who told me it is just constipation and i should take a laxative but it just persists.

2861,t3_am3srl,"The following are natural remedies for constipation that at first may seem too simple to work, but I’m sure one of these will work for you. 

You will notice a recurring theme here, which is that your bowels are more likely to move first thing in the morning and many of the remedies necessitate you employ them first thing in the morning. 

Feel free to try more than one in the same day, or you can try one at a time. 

1. Drink 1-2 liters of water in a short time span. And then go for a walk. 

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

* I started drinking twice as much water and that absolutely helped.
* I make sure to walk enough each day. 
* I took a laxative in hopes that I could break up any blockages a month ago. That seemed to get things moving.  It was only on one occasion, but it seemed effective.
* Eat less sugar. 
* I also started making my own bread. Nothing fancy, just some homemade wheat bread and white bread. That has made a big difference! I eat bread everyday at breakfast.

It had never gotten too bad because since about 2nd grade I’ve been on adhd medicine which most of them are stimulants so they have helped keep me regular. But recently, I’ve went to the dr for stomach and side pain, which I assumed was either my ovarian cysts or my kidney cyst which I recently gotten diagnosed with, but the doctor said that they shouldn’t really be causing me pain. So I got an ultrasound and they said that I had mild constipation and told me to take a laxative. Instead I just ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a fiber bar and waited, which helped me finally go to the bathroom. I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up?

&amp;#x200B;

  
Since I was 6, I've had issues with constipation; I cannot remember a time in my life where I have not had to worry about it. Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help. Or does senna take most of that away? **I know you guys are not doctors, or a substitute, but I need reassurance it'll be ok, or that there's something else I can do to help myself since all but two doctors have dismissed my issues in my 14 years of visits.**     


&amp;#x200B;

**tldr; severe chronic constipation with exceptional pain, don't know how to cope emotionally/physically or advocate for myself, haven't been given enough information on what I've been dealing with. advice/reassurance I'm not going to die when I finally go to the bathroom so I don't hold it in would be appreciated. Or should I just skip all this and head to the ER? Literally anything would help me out right now.** ",Constipation
2892,t3_a4p633,"This is a very personal post but a serious problem, not really sure where else on the internet to post this.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out. I drink a LOT of water daily by the way, at least 6 bottles of 16oz water a day.",Constipation

I’ve only been passing small, hard pebbles and straining a lot :( at first I tried prunelax as I thought something gentle would do me good but only pebbles the next day still. Next, I tried Miralax as I thought that was a strong choice but only pebbles still. I’m now on day 2 of miralax but it wasn’t doing anything so I also took a Dulcolax suppository today. This of course stimulated some bowel movement but it was just getting out hard pebbles still! And that’s where I am now, still feeling the effects of Dulcolax but not really pooping much more. Could it be it was just the pebbles that needed to come out? Will the Dulcolax still do more? It’s been 3 hours now and no real BM have occurred. What should I do? Any advice?

I had a hemmoroidectomy to remove horribly large external ones but internal ones were left untouched due to safety concerns with my surgeon. I also got sick a lot as a kid. 

I used to drink milk constantly. I have now since cut that out mostly and only drink a coffee a day and water. I eat blue berry fiber bars everyday and salad. I've had prune juice, stool softeners, mild laxatives all yielding various to no results. Finally I found super colon cleanse (green bottle) in pill form.  Taking it gave me mad painful stomach cramps and sometimes diaherreha but afterwards I felt so much better. Didn't feel like I had to go the rest of the day. Stopped getting sick, migraines, and other stomach related issues. 

 The bottle says to only take it for 10 days every two months. I tried that and went right back to having a hard time passing anything. So I went back on it. I didn't always take 4 pills a day sometimes only 2 or even none but I went far beyond the 10 days. About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end! I tried the regular colon cleanse (red bottle) by the same company which is just phsylium husk and other stuff but it's not making much of a difference. 

I had X-rays at a medical clinic done a few months ago saying my colon was fine but was very impacted with feces. When I went for this x-ray I was experiencing horrible stomach pain.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out. It continued like a storm and it hurt so fucking bad I could not just stop, the bowel movement was like operating on its own all i could do was control the straining intensity for most part of this traumatic experience. It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax?

2940,t3_949taj,"This is happened to me twice in one year, and I'm wondering if its because I have chronic constipation issues. The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better. The next day I was week and exhausted, but felt way better.

Now I thought maybe this had been caused by food poisoning or something, but I'm now wondering if my body is purging itself after being so constipated for so long. 

Has this happened to anyone else out there? Does your body eventually just say, I need a deep cleaning, and put you through this hell?

2944,t3_934n6z,"Today, I went to the ER for severe constipation.  Sounds strange right?  

Here's the story.  I have been overall having some issues with constipation ever since I have been in wellburtin xl (generic) about 3 months ago.  I'm currently on the 300 mg.   This medication has been making me constipated.  I've only really been getting minor issues with it initially so I've been just doing the basics in terms of treating the symptoms.  

This week I have been having hard pebble stools (level 1) on the stool chart starting last Monday.  These defecations were 1 a day but only minor stool was passed.  My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.

**ISSUE:** I get constipation regularly. About half the days in a given month I am constipated. It takes the form of: In ability to pass stool. Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain. Of course this causes stress and a clouded mind/ bad mood whenever I'm like this because who wouldn't be upset when they can't poop? I get pain in the TOP of my stomach, the ascending colon (look down front right part of abdominal area above the pelvis.), and my right side.   

**TYPICAL PERIOD OF CONSTIPATION:**  Anywhere from 7-14 days. ( if it becomes the longer I end up eating soft foods and/or having little hunger.)

**TRIED METHODS:**  Smooth move tea ( worked when I was a kid, not anymore) , Miralax, Olive oil ( works on occasion if things are not too stuck up), Metamucil, changing diet and exercise ( and sticking to it), Increasing liquid intake, increasing fiber from diet, v8, juices, dried fruits, stretching, self massage ( only works if stomach is not tight from pain or distention which it is tight 9/10 times) , PT for corrective breathing/pushing. GI given trial of linzess.

**COLONOSCOPY:** Came back 100&amp;#37; clean. 

**SEEN GI:**  Report told me I suffer from IBS -C ( aka they don't have a root cause) , and he is worried I may develop colon cancer in 10 years from the chronic stress on my colon ( also some adjacent family history of colon cancer.

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon. This could very well be the case, but then do I not have any other choice but to take stimulant laxatives for relief?

I tried DGL and after two days I started to notice some sensation had returned, the movements were a bit stronger, and more was coming. As the days went on, the urge to go became stronger. Before I was really ""listening"" for the slightest indication I needed to go, but after starting DGL I began to notice I had strong enough urges that I had to drop whatever I was doing and go to the rest room.
Now I'm feeling pretty good, maybe 90%, enough to say I feel pretty much back to normal.

Just wanted to put this out there for others to try.

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

This is the DGL I use, I take one in the morning on an empty stomatch with water, coffee an hour later. I usually fast in the morning, I only drink straight coffee, nothing added. Licorice interferes with blood clotting drugs, make sure to read about other contraindications.

I'm currently on a treatment plan to take 3 dulcolax every other day. The old literature all said taking laxatives regularly is bad, but I've been to multiple specialists who say this is no longer the case. 

The problem with dulcolax is that it causes a ton of gas, which is uncomfortable and painful.

3006,t3_5vvryq,"A year ago my guts slowed down, don't know why, but I was only pooping once every 5 or 6 days. The turds were hard as rocks, the diameter was large, and it took 20 or 30 minutes to get them out of me.

Naturally I spent a lot of time reading about constipation and trying different home remedies. Here's what I've settled on.

(1) Drink coffee before eating breakfast. I never used to drink coffee but I gave it a try and it seems to help.

(2) Gradually increased the amount of fiber I eat. Most fruits and vegetables don't contain enough fiber to make it worth eating them. Seriously, look up the number of grams of fiber per 100 grams of apple or celery; it's not worth the trouble of chewing them and swallowing them!

Split peas and lentils, which are very easy to cook, contain a worthwhile amount of fiber. And chia seeds, of course. A tablespoon of chia seeds in 4 tablespoons of warm water forms a disgusting glop that is chock full of healthy fiber.

(3) Take a magnesium supplement. Some days I take magnesium citrate capsules, other days I dissolve half a teaspoon of epsom salt (which is magnesium sulfate) in water and chug it down.

(4) I reduced my consumption of bananas, cheese, and calcium-based antacids (Tums). I read that they have a ""binding"" effect on some people.

3009,t3_5nmxg6,"Hello, 
I am a 19 year old female. 
I have been constipated since the 31st of December. It was a Saturday night. The last thing I ate that night was a takeaway pizza. Now, usually after eating pizza I get diarrhoea, so I was curious the next morning when I realised the food didn't exit my body. 

Fast forward to Tuesday, I bought Ducolax laxatives and they worked their magic on my bowels within 4 hours. I took another pill on Thursday as I had ate a lot of food that week and my bowels didn't seem to be working on their own. The pill didn't work. I took another laxative on Friday which didn't work also. 

I bought Milk of Magnesia, which is magnesium hydroxide, and it worked on the Saturday of that week. I drank 6 5 ml cups of the milk last night and I've had diarrhoea 4 times since then. Diarrhoea is a side effect of the milk. I examined my stool and it was paper thin and had ragged edges, does that make sense? It looked like pieces of ripped toilet paper. 
I have been smelling a foul odor in my mouth, but I brush my teeth many times a day and I am drinking lots of water. I think it is the food rotting inside my body. 
Does anyone have any suggestions for what could be wrong?

Have you ever experienced difficulty in passing your bowels? Almost everyone goes through this at some point in their lives. Being constipated is not a very serious issue but it can be discomforting if it happens often.

When a person has bowel movements less than three times a week or if you have pain or strain while passing your daily motion, you could be suffering from constipation.

While there are no “right” number of times you out to move your bowels, medical experts say it you should pass motion at least once a day.

The most common symptoms of constipation are:

You suffer from bloating or abdominal cramps
Movement of bowels requires a lot of strain
Hard or small stools
You have to depend on laxatives or special food such as yogurt, cereals packed with fiber or oatmeal, juices etcetera
Constipation is usually caused by a number of factors, some of them are:

Low water intake
Lack of fibrous food in the diet
Lack of physical exercise
Over dose of laxatives
There are many ways to avoid constipation in both adults and kids. Here, we list out a few home remedies for constipation or certain treatments that you can perform by yourself to help cure constipation.

Include high fibre food in your diet.
Fibrous food prevents your stools from becoming hard. They help in adding bulk in your motion. When you start adding fibrous food in your diet, ensure you do so little by little as your digestive system will need to get used to it. Some examples of fibrous food are split peas, lentils, black beans, avocado, bran flakes, whole wheat pasta, pearled barley, oatmeal.
Increase water intake.
One well known method to prevent constipation is to liquid forms of food such as soups and juices in one’s diet. Movement of bowels is easier as the stool becomes bulky and softer because of the increased fluid in the colon. Medical experts recommend an adult drinks 2 liters of water a day.
Regular physical exercise.
Doctors recommend that individuals exercise at least 30 minutes every day. Regular exercise enhances blood flow and keeps the various organs active thereby improving digestion.
Keeping these tips in mind, you can prevent constipation. There are many supplements that will help you add fibre into your diet.

Basically, I've only had small pebbles / small pencil-shaped BMs for around 8 or 9 days now. No sizable BMs. I was very dehydrated and eating horribly when this started (an anomaly for me) which almost certainly triggered it, so I've been drinking 3 liters of water and eating much much healthier every day since.

I went to a GI doctor 4 days ago and he told me to take Miralax once daily and to supplement with Metamucil if I want, which I've been doing. It hasn't really helped as far as I can tell. I'm not in pain, just mild discomfort, but I'm a little worried and want to nip this in the bud. Today is day 8, and I took a full dose (30ml) of Milk of Magnesia this morning and it only resulted in a few small bursts of green powdery-looking diarrhea — which I sense may be the Metamucil fiber mixed with the green chlorophyll of all the vegetables I'm eating. Now I've just inserted a glycerin suppository 30 minutes ago but I'm not really feeling anything at all.

I've had pretty bad constipation issues for the past 3.5 years (taking a shit one day per week, often by using senna). I've tried a ton of things, including huge amounts of fiber supplements, fibrous foods and  PEG 3350. Nothing worked for more than two weeks. I was pretty convinced I had a case of lazy gut syndrome (low motility).Recently, I realized I had a pretty bad form with my deadlifts (rounded back) and even though I've never hurt myself, I've looked into what was the issue. Two things: I've switched to sumo deadlifts and I had lower back mobility issues (I had trouble leaning forward and keeping my back straight from the lower back). So, I've decided to find ways to contract my lower back muscles most of the time so it becomes more natural to me.

A side effect from that was that I was slouching much less on my chair at work (which has always been comfortable for me for long period of times). About 2-3 days later, I noticed I would take a shit once a day. I'm 4 weeks later and I've been regular since.

When I added exercise in Feb 2019 (first very infrequent, but progressively more frequent, and more intense) my appetite spiked, my body weight plateaued, and my constipation increased. I began monitoring fiber intake as well as calories and took my daily avg fiber intake from the \~20g per day ballpark into the 65+ grams per day ballpark, with only sporadic success. I became more diligent about monitoring fluid intake. I used magnesium citrate on occasion to alleviate long lapses in bowel movement (BM). And then the idea occurred to me: the primary mechanism of magnesium citrate is that the Mg in the gut increase fluid absorption into the gut. So maybe just a relatively high does Magnesium dietary supplement (magnesium oxide) would suffice?

I began to take Magnesium oxide dietary supplement a little over two weeks ago, initially 250mg and then upped to 400, as well as a daily probiotic supplement (Bacillus coagulans, 500 million active cells). Exercise frequency and intensity have continued to increase to a present level of 3 times per week for about 4 hours total (1 hour biking, 1 hour climbing 2 hours calisthenics). This seems to be doing the trick!

Having monitored BM everyday for the past 3 weeks or so, I can see that: for the first week once per 4 day period was typical, but during the past two weeks there was only one day without a BM.

3066,t3_b6s95d,"Enjoy my throwaway username lol

I've always had a problem with super hard poop and chronic constipation.  I don't know why, always been that way.  I eat a decent amount of fiber, my diet is pretty damn healthy, lots of salads and greens.  But it's always hard.  Always.  So I got super constipated one day last October and it basically tore me a new one.  I've been trying and failing to heal it ever since because it's impossible for me to get soft stool.  It's misery.  Currently I apply A+D cream on the daily to help keep things soft and less likely to crack open and that's helped some, but my MAIN issue is just...omg nothing helps the hard stool.  I have been taking three 100 mg docusate sodium pills per day for the past few weeks interspersed with the occasional senna-S when things seem to slow down a bit.  I've been tracking my water intake for months and take in over a gallon of water per day.  Yes, I'm constantly pissing!  It's annoying but I'm so miserable that I'm willing to put up with it!  I occasionally grab a Fiber One chewy bar if my fiber seems low for the day.  I'm mostly vegetarian and allergic to milk so I eat a LOT of fiber already, definitely not a cheese-a-tarian.

The combo of senna and docusate and even docusate ALONE with the gallon+ of water keeps me going regularly in the morning, but it doesn't soften anything.  I'm going to try psyllium here soon when I get to the store next but what could possibly be CAUSING this resistance to anything that could soften things up back there?  It's getting to be a little ridiculous, doing everything I can and still tearing open my fissure every.  Damn.  Morning.  Because I can't soften my stools.  


OH and edit:  I went to my PCP's office about a month ago and she seemed completely resistant to any other options for me other than surgery to heal just the fissure and could offer no real suggestions other than referring me to a surgeon.  This is something I am going to avoid as long as possible because I'm certain the reason I'm not healing is because my ass just refuses to pass anything but rock hard lumps.

After sitting on the toilet for 1/2 hour, I realized something was wrong. The pressure was building up but nothing was coming out. By this time, I started to get painful cramps and I could tell I was compacted.
I reached behind and felt my anus. I have one persistent hemorrhoid that was bulging out along with several others. They were all very thick and soft but had not ruptured. 
It was apparent to me that the compacted mass of poop had worked it's way overnight into position behind my rectum and now was putting pressure on the veins, pushing them outside.
I was worried I was having a prolapse.
I gently put pressure on the external veins until I was able to stick my finger in and move the compaction away from my rectum. While still standing, I then started squeezing my anus and lower abs to support my veins.

Once walking became comfortable, I began gathering supplies to make an enema device from rubber tubing and a dish soap bottle. Despite the fact I couldn't find the correct tubing and I made a mess of the bathroom floor, I managed to get enough soapy water to stay in to soften it slightly. 
I then realized we have a sitz bath with a bag and a tube that was perfect.
The first few attempts resulted in bouts of watery poop squirting out my anus and running down my legs.
In addition, the first few times I removed the tube  water was spraying out of it and getting everywhere. 
I then realized I needed to hold the bag below my butt and pinch the tube shut before removing it.
I persisted, all the while wiping the toilet down and acquiring a collection of sopping wet towels and rags on the floor of my tiny bathroom
I had the tap running and I would rinse the tube off (and wash my hands) each time.
Eventually, the compacted poop started to break apart and pieces started to come out unexpectedly. 
Each time, I was able to insert the tube further
I would move in in and out a bit each time I pushed it further up, squeezing the bag as much as I could.
As I was standing and clenching my butthole, butt cheeks and lower abs as much as possible, this combined with the softened compaction reduced its diameter and I was able to get it out.
I spent the next 2 hours disinfecting everything in the bathroom, including the enema bag and tube.
I changed toothbrushes, took a shower and reflected on how much we take pooping for granted.
I think every household should have an enema device on hand and know how to safely use it.

Btw, the last time I gave myself an enema, I was able to stand in the bathtub and use a garden hose. Please use extreme caution if you ever need to do this.
It worked well though.

3094,t3_am3srl,"The following are natural remedies for constipation that at first may seem too simple to work, but I’m sure one of these will work for you. 

You will notice a recurring theme here, which is that your bowels are more likely to move first thing in the morning and many of the remedies necessitate you employ them first thing in the morning. 

Feel free to try more than one in the same day, or you can try one at a time. 

1. Drink 1-2 liters of water in a short time span. And then go for a walk. 

2. Hot black coffee and put 1 TBSP butter or extra virgin coconut oil in it and consume on an empty stomach. 

3. Drink 1 liter of water with a probiotic. The large amount of water helps to move the probiotic quickly through your digestive system.  

4. Drink some water and go for a jog. The up and down and torso twisting motion accompanied with water can help get things moving. 

5. 4 TBSP Yerba mate loose leaf brewed and drank on an empty stomach.  

6. First thing in the morning alternatively take sips of room temp water and hot black coffee. 

7. Drink water and perform various abdomen stretches.  

8. Relax mentally and physically. Bowels will not move if you are stressed and living in fight or flight mode.

3095,t3_alxqu9,"From now on, I won't even consider staying in a friend's house, which is small, more than one day.

We have arranged a meeting kinda thing for like a week and we came to this friend's house which is 6-7 hours of driving away from our houses. So I'm stuck here, in this tiny apartment which i don't even feel comfy. And besides the comfort, the kitchen is 2 steps away from the toilet and also the living area is like 5 steps and the only room is just next to the toilet. Meaning, you will be not even 4 metres away from your friends when you're taking a sh*t. And I am so tired of this that im writing a post about it, I hated it. So much 

So being constipated and being in your own toilet, i miss that guys.

3096,t3_alx4m7,"For as long as I can remember I haven't gone often. At the most I go once every 3 or 4 days and at the least (that I've kept track of) it's been about 2 weeks, and on average I go once a week. 
I've tried Colace and it didn't really do much so I stopped taking it all together. (Why pay for something that doesn't work?) 

My main question is, should I be concerned? 

My doctor wasn't exactly... Helpful. She suggested Miralax, which I am in the middle of trying, and said she would percribe something if that didnt help. In the back of my mind I am wondering if something more serious could be going on. She ordered an x-ray and an ultrasound which came back normal, besides showing I was constipated (surprise!) She doesn't exactly seem confident in any of her suggestions which kind of makes me loose confidence too. I'm wondering if I should be trying to go to a specialist. ",Constipation

3098,t3_akp8ie,"I've dealt with constipation my whole life, although I didn't know what it was as a kid.  I found this sub and finally decided to do something about it.  I've had such relief taking some of your advice and hearing your success stories.  Maybe my strategies will help someone else?

* I started drinking twice as much water and that absolutely helped.
* I make sure to walk enough each day. 
* I took a laxative in hopes that I could break up any blockages a month ago. That seemed to get things moving.  It was only on one occasion, but it seemed effective.
* Eat less sugar. 
* I also started making my own bread. Nothing fancy, just some homemade wheat bread and white bread. That has made a big difference! I eat bread everyday at breakfast. I'm not sure if its the fiber increase, or maybe eliminating some preservatives  from my diet that are in store-bought bread, but I haven't had an issue since. I attribute a lot of my relief to making my own bread.

I'm probably going to go to a GI just in case, but thanks to all who post! I've enjoyed hearing your strategies. ",Constipation

I always get backed up during those times. Anyways, I’ve been taking a magnesium oxide supplement every night before bed for the past two weeks. (It’s 500mg magnesium oxide plus electrolytes).

3103,t3_ajx5c8,"I've had constipation my whole life and had many instances where I had a blockage. Finally, at an age of 24, I figured out what really was causing my constipation. It was bread. My whole life I tried to eat whole wheat bread and thought that it was helping the cause. I realized that even though its whole wheat with fiber, the bread ITSELF was the one causing the majority of my chronic constipation. I stopped intaking bread.. or at least limiting it substantially to the point where after 4 to 5 months I've been mainly constipated free with normal bowel movements. Occasional constipation, but I've managed to be able to go daily. I can even ingest a lot of cheese now crazy enough.

But about 2 years ago, I started noticing something different. It hurt a lot to relieve myself and I'd have to strain to get the shit out. And it came out a little dry. I didn't really see it as a problem and just got through it. I should also mention that since I was a child, whenever I had the urge to go, I held it back until I couldn't. I thought that this was something that was just a normal thing to do. Anyway for two years, I just went through the pain and dry poop (it happened irregularly. Somedays I went to poop without any pain or strain). However a month ago, something changed. I went an entire week and a half without pooping. And I could feel my stomach getting bigger, like there was a load on it, but I just didn't have the urge to go. When I went to the doctor, he simply gave simple laxative medicine and some diet advice, however a month has gone by and I cannot poop naturally.

I’ve been using some laxatives and have managed to pass a couple decent stools.

I have accepted that it is the way my body works and I am not trying to change it. It would be different if I experienced some case of serious impaction, then I would look for some remedy and changes in my diet to make my bowel movements softer and more frequent.

3120,t3_a8vvm9,"Soo I’m 15 years old and for as long as I can remember I’ve had trouble with constipation. It had never gotten too bad because since about 2nd grade I’ve been on adhd medicine which most of them are stimulants so they have helped keep me regular. But recently, I’ve went to the dr for stomach and side pain, which I assumed was either my ovarian cysts or my kidney cyst which I recently gotten diagnosed with, but the doctor said that they shouldn’t really be causing me pain. So I got an ultrasound and they said that I had mild constipation and told me to take a laxative. Instead I just ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a fiber bar and waited, which helped me finally go to the bathroom. I know I should have listened to the doctor, but I didn’t, anyways I was regular for a few days and then I stopped going for like 4 days (which I know isn’t too long but I started getting stomach aches and stuff) and I was getting stomach aches and I was afraid to eat because like if I eat and I’m not going to the bathroom isn’t my food going to keep piling up? Anyways I’m going to the bathroom everyday again but only with my adhd medicine and I still don’t go as much as I usually do, I’m trying to incorporate fiber bars into my diet and just improve my diet overall because it’s not the best. But the reason I asked this is because when I talked to my grandmother about it she said it is probably just ibs but idk because it’s not like I have diarrhea sometimes and constpation others, it’s more like I’m usually constipated. Also colon issues run in my family, my mom passed away from colon cancer, my grandmothers brother passed away from diverticulitis because it went untreated, and her other brother also passed away from colon cancer. So I don’t know if this could be related to something like that. It just stresses me out. I havnt been to the dr for this specifically and I don’t know if I should.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Since I was 6, I've had issues with constipation; I cannot remember a time in my life where I have not had to worry about it. Initially I only had small problems with it, but I developed a minor psychosis problem that made me believe I was being watched while using the bathroom, and I started ignoring the urge to go; obviously it made the constipation a lot worse. I have been through therapy and no longer believe that, however the severity of the constipation still remains. I have tried all sorts of different things; different suppositories, laxatives (mineral oil, magnesium, you name it), diet changes, tons of water, and exercise. In the end, I was told to just stay on Miralax until I was 'cleaned out' (usually required 3-4 doses), and then take either psyllium husks or small doses of miralax afterwards to help keep me regular until I am able to go to the bathroom without issues. However, my child life from this point on was one in poverty, and miralax is expensive, so most times I would not be able to follow those instructions. I would be constipated for 3+ weeks before being able to buy miralax and go to the bathroom (with a lot of straining, sickness, and pain).  


For example, Once when I was 10, I even had severe abdominal pain/inability to even pass gas or urinate, which I now recognize as an impaction; I don't even know how I got rid of it, just that it hurt more than anything, and I had literal complete incontinence issues &amp; numbness for 2 days after. :(   

  
Even though money is no object nowadays, when I try to taper off, my body will at least kind of? painfully function for a month after I finish the process, but then I suddenly stop getting urges to use the bathroom at all and become immediately severely constipated within like 2 days. Almost every doctor I have had tends to tell me ""just clear it out and then we'll talk again"" when I see them, and then when I do and have painful symptoms they just tell me ""go when you have to"" and ""its no longer a problem"" apparently. In addition, because I've been forced to jump around between having a GP and using a walk-in, when I tell a doctor my full history they just tell me the same thing over and over, which I'm sure would have bankrupted me if I hadn't been born in Canada. I am very jaded at this point. I feel like I've tried everything except for checking myself into the ER, I'm at a loss.  

  
If any of you guys have had issues with doctors not taking you seriously please let me know how you deal with it... I just got a new GP and Im honestly scared to talk to her about it, not because she's mean but because I'm scared she'll just say ""that's normal try again"" and I think I might have a breakdown. There's no way this is normal, I have cleared myself out for years and no one has done anything for me even though it's very obvious something else is going wrong in addition. My family has a history of IBS so I think I might have it too, and I have mentioned this before, but to be fair, obviously there's not much a doctor can do when they only see me 2-3 times before I have to switch again.  

  
Right now I am in one of those constipated periods, and finally a walk-in doctor told me they were shocked I hadn't been told to try extra strength senna, which I just took two tablets of for the first time. *This is very emotionally/physically distressing to me, because the actual going part - even with twice the prescribed dose of miralax- is so painful I often find myself thinking I would rather die or have an ileostomy when it's actually time to go*. I'm honestly worried that the senna won't be strong enough and I'll just be in perpetual pain for a couple of hours while my body tries to force me to go. I am getting horrible defecation anxiety right now because of past experiences which I am sure isn't helping. I usually have to also strain till I feel dizzy, I also get unbearable burning pain in my rectum during/afterwards and no feeling of complete emptiness. It's driving me insane.  

  
How do you guys deal with the pain of going to the bathroom with severe constipation??? I'm finding myself avoiding the bathroom because it hurts so much, but I know I need to go asap before it gets worse. Is there a way to reduce the pain? a breathing technique, or something similar would really help. Or does senna take most of that away? **I know you guys are not doctors, or a substitute, but I need reassurance it'll be ok, or that there's something else I can do to help myself since all but two doctors have dismissed my issues in my 14 years of visits.**     


&amp;#x200B;

**tldr; severe chronic constipation with exceptional pain, don't know how to cope emotionally/physically or advocate for myself, haven't been given enough information on what I've been dealing with. advice/reassurance I'm not going to die when I finally go to the bathroom so I don't hold it in would be appreciated. Or should I just skip all this and head to the ER? Literally anything would help me out right now.** ",Constipation
3125,t3_a4p633,"This is a very personal post but a serious problem, not really sure where else on the internet to post this.

As the title says, I've been constipated since as long as I can remember. I'm 25 now, I remember when I was 6, my stool was so large I couldn't flush a toilet without breaking it up because it wouldn't fit down the toilet. Same thing today, somewhat. I usually go to the bathroom once a WEEK.

I don't make enough to afford health insurance, even then, I would still have a bill too large to pay a visit WITH health insurance.

There was a brief time I was unemployed and had state health insurance. I took a visit to the hospital and the doctor prescribed me Polyethylene glycol 3350 (aka miralax). He told me if it worked, to take it every day for the rest of my life. I've been taking it almost every day for the last 2 years. But what I want to know, is how do I actually fix my constipation? 

I walk/run 10-15 miles a day at work (according to step counters), I've tried all kinds of changes in diets, coming to learn that more fiber is actually worse for me. I went on diets with lots of vegetables, steamed white rice, soups, probiotic yogurts, etc. I also believe I'm borderline becoming diabetic, so I've extremely cut back on sugars. None of it made a difference to the constipation. The only thing that works is the polyethylene, but the problem is if I miss it for even one day, it doesn't work. 

Is my stomach just broken? Am I supposed to actually be getting some sort of surgery? If I miss the polyethylene for a single day now, instead of large chunks that can't even be flushed down a toilet, it comes out in dozens of tiny balls that mostly can't even be pushed out. I drink a LOT of water daily by the way, at least 6 bottles of 16oz water a day.",Constipation

Does anyone have constipation the week or so before your period? For that week I literally can’t go and usually have to take Durolax.

1. Drink 2-3 table spoons of vegetable oil twice daily.
2. Do this over about 3 days.

I had a hemmoroidectomy to remove horribly large external ones but internal ones were left untouched due to safety concerns with my surgeon. I also got sick a lot as a kid. 

I used to drink milk constantly. I have now since cut that out mostly and only drink a coffee a day and water. I eat blue berry fiber bars everyday and salad. I've had prune juice, stool softeners, mild laxatives all yielding various to no results. Finally I found super colon cleanse (green bottle) in pill form.  Taking it gave me mad painful stomach cramps and sometimes diaherreha but afterwards I felt so much better. Didn't feel like I had to go the rest of the day. Stopped getting sick, migraines, and other stomach related issues. 

 The bottle says to only take it for 10 days every two months. I tried that and went right back to having a hard time passing anything. So I went back on it. I didn't always take 4 pills a day sometimes only 2 or even none but I went far beyond the 10 days. About a few months ago I recently discovered the seena leaf ingredients in it can lead to permanent damage. So I got scared and quit. Now I'm back to square one and now those hemmoroids are hurting and sometimes bleeding again. I want this to end! I tried the regular colon cleanse (red bottle) by the same company which is just phsylium husk and other stuff but it's not making much of a difference. 

I had X-rays at a medical clinic done a few months ago saying my colon was fine but was very impacted with feces. When I went for this x-ray I was experiencing horrible stomach pain. The super colon cleanse made that pass in combination with quitting milk. However as I stated I am afraid to take that stuff long term and risk damage though I wonder if the damage from a full colon is even worse.

I went to the pharmacy to get an enema bc I was over the fact that a bowel movement was gonna be possible but my grandma told me to do a lot of exercice. I thought fuck it why not it's not like it's gonna change something. Did an hour of bicycle, then did squats and some treadmill at the park. I noticed that after this I was able to fart (first time in a day) and felt something was going on.

I get back at my house with the enema (which helped me last time I was this impacted) and it kinda made me relax for the first time since I realized I had hemorrhoids because I knew it was gonna work. I go to the bathroom to try one last time and see if I can not have a BM.

I get in the squatting position and i try to not strain but I do a little bit just to see if something happens. Another flatulence happens so I'm pretty stoked so I try doing more and then it happened.

I let out a tiny speck of poop wich had an almond piece in it. I'm super stoked. Then I  strain a bit more and it hit me. I felt this big piece and I couldn't not stop straining even if I wanted to. A ball of whiteish layered covered feces popped out. It continued like a storm and it hurt so fucking bad I could not just stop, the bowel movement was like operating on its own all i could do was control the straining intensity for most part of this traumatic experience. It was like the last time i did the fleet enema (my first time doing one actually) but it hurt even more cause it was not liquid diarrhea it was like this light brown semi solid paste that would not stop coming out but very slowly and very painfully. My asshole opened so fucking much when i strained so I decided to disimpact manually and scooped. At a certain moment I couldnt just strain,I had to scoop it a lot and it was so fucking stressing. It didnt stop for like an hour. I also had a lot of difficulty peeing and had to do a kegel exercise to manage to urinate. All the while, I was sweating profusely, screaming, shaking a lot and feeling numb in the legs/arms. After a while it became even harder and it hurt even more. Then after an hour and the biggest pain, I let out these huge turds,enema style as it ploped out directly. 

I feel drained, very nauseous and my butt is hella sore. I took some electrolyte solution as I did with the enema just in case of electroly imbalance and now I'm wondering if I should even eat.

I feel really concerned about this, could it be bowel incontinence/leak or simply the effect of miralax? 
I have my appointment tomorrow so i'll let my GP know but still I'm really shocked/happy but also terrified of this becoming an habit.

The first time it happened I was at work and my stomach started cramping, I felt dizzy and nauseous and ended up going home. All day I felt like I need to go to the bathroom, but nothing was coming out, I felt so sick to my stomach, and I just assumed it was a bug or something. When I finally could go (it wasnt until that night, so it was running to bathroom every 30 minutes to just sit there crying in pain) it was the worst thing ever, and the best thing ever, I am pretty sure that months worth of back up came out, it was horrible and painful, but when it was over I felt so much better.

 Like I was truly empty for the first time in years. I of course clogged the toilet, and owe my SO a debt so large I may never be able to repay it. I was shaky and sick for days after this, but felt better. It took me a couple weeks to get back to normal and feel strong again. Like I said I thought it was some kind of 24 hour bug. 

Then a couple months ago I woke up in the morning and my stomach hurt, just a little cramping, so I tried to go to the bathroom, but of course nothing happened. As the day went on it got worse and worse and worse, the cramps were making me cry, and I was running to the bathroom every 20-30 minutes, trying to get anything to pass, but nothing would. 

All day long this went on, until I could not take the pain any longer and had my SO drive me to the ER, the trip there takes 30 minutes, but it took up as least an hour or more because he had to stop and find bathrooms every 10-20 minutes. Nothing would come out, but it felt like it was going to. When we got to the ER, I was running to the bathroom every 5-10 minutes, in agony of stomach cramps, it was seriously the worst pain ever, I had also vomited a few times, from pushing so hard. My stomach was pushing by itself, it was just intense muscle spasms and cramping. 

Finally afer almost a full 12 hours of this horror the dams burst loose. I ended up in the bathroom at the ER, just crying as all hell burst forth from me. I have never gone so much in my life, not even the first time this happened to me. By the end, it was pure liquid coming out of me, but the cramping subsided finally. The drs gave me something for pain (they literally sucked because it had been hours that I was there before anyone ever even looked at me) and I went home, still having to go every 30 minutes, but I was feeling so so much better. The next day I was week and exhausted, but felt way better.

Now I thought maybe this had been caused by food poisoning or something, but I'm now wondering if my body is purging itself after being so constipated for so long.

Here's the story.  I have been overall having some issues with constipation ever since I have been in wellburtin xl (generic) about 3 months ago.  I'm currently on the 300 mg.   This medication has been making me constipated.  I've only really been getting minor issues with it initially so I've been just doing the basics in terms of treating the symptoms.  

This week I have been having hard pebble stools (level 1) on the stool chart starting last Monday.  These defecations were 1 a day but only minor stool was passed.  My last defacation that I remembered was a small one around Thursday or Friday.  Nothing Saturday, but was experiencing some minor discomfort.  Tried defacation Saturday evening with no success.  This morning I tried going again and no luck. This time, things started to get real uncomfortable and increeasingly  painful.

Later in the morning was the kicker.  I was cold  sweating panting and feeling almost as if I was going to pass out.  I said that's enough, I'm going to emerge.

Got in, Doctor examined me.  His diagnosis was that there was some severe consipation and there is some blockage in the lower  intestine.  He ordered an xray for confirmation and to is if there was any bigger issue.

Sure enough the lower intestine was blocked up pretty bad.  Nothing was in the rectum but above it is were the blockage was determined by the doc.  He sent me home with the laxitave to help with moving the fecal matter though. He also suggested that I use a fleet enema to help with the passing.

Well finally got home and it was round two.  But I had a ringer in my corner.  Let's just say it passed thankfully!  Basically it was the biggest stool I have ever passed in my life.  Same dicomfort with the passing.  

Part of my concerns with going to the ER was the intensity of the discomfort and pain.  I felt it was the right thing to do despite mild embarrassment. But I didn't care, I was really uncomfortable.  

Is it possible to rip your rectum or rupture during a massive stool/constipation?

**ISSUE:** I get constipation regularly. About half the days in a given month I am constipated. It takes the form of: In ability to pass stool. Sensation of needing to go ( the BM is ""there and ready"" but it wont move) , Bloating, gas, distention, abdominal pain. Of course this causes stress and a clouded mind/ bad mood whenever I'm like this because who wouldn't be upset when they can't poop? I get pain in the TOP of my stomach, the ascending colon (look down front right part of abdominal area above the pelvis.), and my right side.   

**TYPICAL PERIOD OF CONSTIPATION:**  Anywhere from 7-14 days. ( if it becomes the longer I end up eating soft foods and/or having little hunger.)

**TRIED METHODS:**  Smooth move tea ( worked when I was a kid, not anymore) , Miralax, Olive oil ( works on occasion if things are not too stuck up), Metamucil, changing diet and exercise ( and sticking to it), Increasing liquid intake, increasing fiber from diet, v8, juices, dried fruits, stretching, self massage ( only works if stomach is not tight from pain or distention which it is tight 9/10 times) , PT for corrective breathing/pushing. GI given trial of linzess.

**COLONOSCOPY:** Came back 100&amp;#37; clean. 

**SEEN GI:**  Report told me I suffer from IBS -C ( aka they don't have a root cause) , and he is worried I may develop colon cancer in 10 years from the chronic stress on my colon ( also some adjacent family history of colon cancer.

Doctors do not seem to think it is an issue that I have to use natural laxative agents to go - if I do not take these I can go up to 2 weeks without having a single bowel movement. I have tried so many things, I am at a loss - I increase my fibre, and it seems to make my constipation even worse. I take probiotics and magnesium supplements. Literally, the only thing that seems to work is stimulant laxatives (I always take natural ones, but I know long-term use of senna is not good either and can create dependency).

I have even been to a specialist who also said he did not have any concerns and to just take Laxaday all the time. Although I understand these are good natural remedies to constipation, I want to know the root cause and issue.  

I have done some research and came across something called slow transit constipation - when fibre and stool softeners don't work for you because there is something wrong with the actual muscles that contract in your colon. This could very well be the case, but then do I not have any other choice but to take stimulant laxatives for relief?

Does anyone know if constipation could be a sign of specific types of allergies? I want to request allergy testing from my doctor, but wnat to know what I am asking for. I know I will ask for dairy allergy testing, and perhaps gluten as well.

I tried DGL and after two days I started to notice some sensation had returned, the movements were a bit stronger, and more was coming. As the days went on, the urge to go became stronger. Before I was really ""listening"" for the slightest indication I needed to go, but after starting DGL I began to notice I had strong enough urges that I had to drop whatever I was doing and go to the rest room.
Now I'm feeling pretty good, maybe 90%, enough to say I feel pretty much back to normal.

Just wanted to put this out there for others to try.

Another supplements I have gone back to trying is Alpha brain, because while I experimented with it years ago, I noticed my bowel movements were noticeably stronger, probably because of the Alpha GPC. So I started taking alpha brain again, but only once ever 3 days or so.

Still taking the probiotic for now.

Also I still take ground flax seed every now and then. I grind up the flax seed in a coffee grinder, then put in some ground cinnamon (best is Ceylon Cinnamon, better for liver, less carcinogens etc.), 3 or 4 cloves, and shake in some nut meg, grind it all together. Then I take a banana mash it up in a bowl with a fork, then mix in the flax seed mixture.

I don't think these 3 things are necessary but I continue to do them until I run out.

This is the DGL I use, I take one in the morning on an empty stomatch with water, coffee an hour later. I usually fast in the morning, I only drink straight coffee, nothing added. Licorice interferes with blood clotting drugs, make sure to read about other contraindications.

I dilute the juice of half a lemon on 500 ml of water and use that to wash my hair, but i don't rinse the lemon water because if i do, the hard water makes my hair waxy again.

The problem i have is that sometimes i feel my scalp a little bit irritated, always have white flakes on my hair and when i put my fingers on my scalp, it feels dry with almost no oil.

If i use any less than half a lemon on 500 ml of water, it makes no effect and it's like washing with only water. So i wanted to ask if there is something i can do to stop the white flakes and dryness in the scalp. So far i've found on the internet that aloe vera spray may help.

3217,t3_blrdtf,"[Video on 5 Great Alternatives to Shampoo](https://youtu.be/Eo8wvesS1kk)

Hello Reddit!It’s FreeDaFro here to deliver the knowledge once again. Today, I will share with you 4 great alternative to Shampoo. As you already know from reading my previous videos, Shampoo is the enemy of my hair. Shampoo takes sebum oil out of your. By stripping your hair of sebum oil, shampoo can cause dry hair, breakage, and decreased hair growth.

The four methods I’m sharing with you today do not throw off your hair’s balance of sebum oil. All of these methods that I am sharing with you today are cheap and naturals. If you want stronger, darker, and thicker hair, I recommend that your use a combination of all of these methods. Each product provides its own unique benefits and the use of a variety of products will produce maximize your hair’s potential over time. These methods are list in no particular order. I find all of these products essential to my hair care regimen.

So here we go:

#1 Onion Juice:

So the first product I recommend you guys to start using is onion juice.
Onion juice is a cheap &amp; natural way to speed up you hair growth.  Onions are great for your hair and body. Onions contain a high amount of sulfur. Sulfur will speeds up your hair growth.Sulfur kills bacteria that rest on your scalp. These bacteria block clog our scalp and prevent hair follicles from emerging from our scalp. Sulfur removes this blockage allowing our hair to grow faster. Sulfur allows helps to remove dandruff from our scalp. Onion juice allows increases the blood flow to your scalp leading to increased hair growth.


Since I started using onion juice in my hair, my hair has become thicker and darker. When you first use it, your scalp will feel like its on fire. That feeling is the onion juice killing all of the bacteria in your hair. I know the idea of putting onion juice in your hair may be appalling to some people. Some of you may be concerned about a lingering onion smell being left in your hair after your hair after you use this method. I usually put  castor oil and conditioner in my hair after I use onion juice. This helps reduce the smell of onions in my hair.

If you want to make onion juice, all you simply need to is cut up and boil and onion. Let the mixture sit in your hair for 1 -2 hours. After letting it sit, rinse your hair with water. Make sure you avoid getting this product in your eyes.

If you commit to using onion juice on a consistent basis, you will see your hair get thicker and fuller.

#2 Clay Mask:

The next thing I recommend you guys try is a clay mask. 
Clay is another natural product of the earth. There are great clays out there Each has its own unique benefits. There are many recipes online but all these recipes have some of the same benefits.
Clays masks do a great job of detoxifying our hair. Tap water contains harmful metals such as lead and chlorine. Overtime, these metals build up in our hair and damage our scalp. Clay’s magnetic properties allow it to carry the metals out of our hair. Clay also kill bacteria in our scalp.

Another great thing about clay mask is that they remove oily buildup from our hair strands. Clays act like a sponge in our hair and they will soak up excess oil that lies on our hair strands. As clays coat our hair strand, it begins to fill in holes on our hair stands. This strengthens our hair and improves our curly pattern.

As I said, there are many clays for our scalp, each has its own benefits. Clay is a great alternative to shampoo because its PH level is more favorable to our scalp. Clay is a gentler way to clean your hair and it reinforces the damaged spots on your hair, unlike shampoo.  There are many clay mask recipes online. I recommend you use this product to remove build-up on your hair.


#3 Apple Cider Vinegar:

The next one I am gonna share you guys is a popular one. Apply Cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is a staple in the natural hair care community. Apple cider vinegar can remove dirty from your hair. Its best property is its ability to break apart sebum oil. When sebum oil is broken into tinier particles, it is easier to move from your scalp to your hair strands. Remember sebum is good from our hair strands because it seals help to seal in moisture. 

Since I started using apple cider vinegar my hair has become more flexible and shiny. I can comb my hair in every direction. I’ve also notice my hair has beomce more shiny too.

* Nice spray cleanse
* Adds shine
* Makes hair easier to manipulate

#4: Co-washing:

Y’all have probably heard of this one before. Co washing is a conditioner only wash. Cowashing creates a protective layer over your hair strands that help seal in moisture. Co washing is a great way to clean your hair throughout the week. If you just came back from the beach or the gym, it is a great way to quickly refresh your hair without removing any oil. 

Be careful. If done incorrectly, co washing can be harmful for our hair. The protective layer created by cowashing doesn’t allow moisture to penetrate into it. If this protective layer is always on your hair, you will not be able to get water into your hair. Overtime you will experience hair breakage. Also avoid putting conditioner on your scalp, conditioner will clog the pores on your scalp. 

You can cowash with any hair conditioner. I recommend that co wash no more that 3 times a week.",NoPoo

I've taken to scritching extremely often. I don't think it's dandruff - the flakes are white, not yellow, and the flakes are fairly small - but it's confusing. I wash my hair once every 3-5 days or so, depending on how oily my hair is. I do a baking soda clean once a month and have started to do an ACV rinse about every week and a half (The ACV smell is really strong!).

She recommended Hairstory [New Wash](https://www.hairstory.com/catalogue/new-wash_1/), which I'm willing to give it a shot.  I've been using Trader Joe's shampoo/conditioner, currently at 5 times a week for poo, 2 for conditioner, trying to reduce that over time.  New Wash is pretty expensive though, $40 for 8 oz.  Looking at some posts here, some recommend [Maneline.](https://manelinehaircare.com/collections/shampoo-conditioner/products/maneline-premium-shampoo-alternative-original)

I was wondering about peoples' experiences with one vs. the other.  Also, New Wash has a built-in conditioner, whereas I think that using Maneline would still need me to condition my hair once or twice a week?

My hair is pretty straight, a bit but not overly oily, and I just got it trimmed to let the front catch up to the back, which is at my shoulders.  Have a bit of a shorter cut in the very front, but it's still several inches long, so more of a side sweep than true bangs; mostly to make my forehead not look as long.

I have an itchy and scaly scalp and am thinning because of it (pretty sure). Been trying dandruff shampoo or anything. 

Recently bought ACV and have been doing every other day rinses instead of dandruff shampoo. Every day I do coconut oil shampoo and conditioner. 

I do the ACV rinse after shampoo. 

Hair feels the same if not worse than with dandruff shampoo. Driving me crazy. All started happening when I moved to Portland Oregon. Is it the water? The air? I’m 22 and a guy. Hairline is in the same place. Just thinner and way weaker.

Thanks for all the responses so far. I use OGX coconut shampoo and conditioner (wasn’t before but doesn’t seem to make a difference). Have tried normal dandruff shampoos. Going to buy t-gel tar shampoo and try that. Sounding like a dermatologist is the only way to figure it out if that doesn’t work. I don’t want to try one of these methods for a possible misdiagnosis while it gets worse. Any thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I have long, straight hair that gets greasy on day two, and I just think washing it is boring. I tried no poo for about 6 months a couple of years ago, but ended up ditching it after travelling a lot and dealing with different kinds of water.   


I've read that scritching, preening and BBBing is essential to no poo, but is that absolutely necessary, or is that just if you do WO?   


I've just started up a no poo routine again, and am currently washing once a week with diluted baking soda (1 tbsp BS + 1 cup water) and using diluted white wine vinegar as a leave-in conditioner. (works amazeballs, but isn't the BS removing a lot of the natural oils? Seeing as the hair gets so squeaky clean) My plan is to move to rye flour after a couple of weeks, when the transition phase is hopefully over, because I've read that BS is damaging to your hair over time. And rye flour worked well the last time I tried it, if I remember correctly.  


Any tips for me? Also, do I really need to deep condition? If so, what's the easiest vegan way to do it?

I've been on and off water only for a bit now. I'm on and off because of my lifestyle and because I love the feeling of super squeaky clean hair. 

I have dry, damaged and thick Asian hair but after lots of botched box dyes and allergic reactions to conditioners to relieve the damage, I've lost/broken alot of it. Weaning into water only really helped the damage and growth, but every time it would get a little too oily, I'd give into shampoo. 

But recently I discovered Shikakai and Reetha Powder as shampoo -- and OH MY GOSH GUYS. My hair is soft, sleek, and moisturized, and it has that squeaky clean feeling. My hair has less breakage and it looks like it too!

I've started nopoo for 2.5 months by only using baking soda and vinegar wash once ever two days (I seriously didn't know it's not recomended). My hair grew out so fast. All my life I've combatted hair thinning and this transition worked so well my hair has never been so thick! FYI I am asian with black straight hair and has thin hair genetics.

 Then I went to the beach and gave into shampoo because I didn't have baking soda with me. That was for a week, then I came home and continued using shampoo because I was out of baking soda. I switched back to shampoo for 2 -3 weeks and finally came back to baking soda. It's still working - my hair is beautiful but it's not the same anymore as when I started. I'm one week back into baking soda &amp; vinegar and washing it once every 2-3 days, but I have been feeling that the baking soda maybe too strong for me, so today I tried just water and then dandruffs appeared right away.

I am currently travelling around Asia and therefore I mostly only wash my hair with cold water. It never felt clean after a wash, actually just more oily. I try to really wash it and rub my scalp a lot. I also dry my hair with a t shirt instead of a towel. I see no difference.

I have thin hair, but because of my waves it doesn't look that way. In those two months it actually looks fine and full. It's just that the feel is very very very oily. I can not get with my fingers through my hair all the way from the scalp. I thought it was just part of the transition but yesterday I noticed very gross and thick layers of, as it looks like, fat/oil build up near my scalp that make my hairs get stuck to each other. I was able to brush those out with three different kind of brushes. A round soft brush, a tangle teezer and a fine comb. That made my whole hair more oily instead of mostly at the scalp. In those last two months I just used the soft round brush, maybe I couldn't reach my scalp that way and therefore the build up?

I am currently in India and it's kind of hard to get a BBB. Same for the shampoos without silicones or sulfates. So I'd rather go through this process without. Is that even possible? Will it just take longer and do I have to be patience? Or am I doing something wrong?

1. I use hair oils a lot, like Coconut oil, Almond oil, Argan oil etc.  and usually wash them out with a shampoo. How would I go about washing them out if I'm going nopoo? Or do I just rub my scalp with normal water and let the oils hopefully soak in and fade away naturally? And I usually condition too, is conditioning recommended during nopoo? And a certain kind? Or is any old conditioner fine?
2. I aim to dye my hair once I'm done with college, in about 2 months or so. I haven't admittedly read up on maintaining dyed hair and all yet since the act is still far off, but is it okay to go nopoo while having dyed hair?

3257,t3_bel08f,"I'm travelling at the moment and I want to give no poo a try. Let me first fill you in on some background. I have normal skin that tends towards dehydration. My scalp health is good too. No dandruff or other scalp problems. My hair length goes to my shoulders and I have a fringe. I'm blessed with curly hair but if there's lots of moisture in the hair it's frizzy af. I can only achieve my curly hair through product and if I want it to really bang, I need heat too. I've some blonde at the bottom half of my hair which is in good condition. I currently can get 5-6 days from each wash. My hair always looks it's best on day 3-4, because the natural oils dampen down the frizz and flyaways. I never use dry shampoo because I'm lazy. 

Now for my routine. Before I get into the shower, I run my fingers vigorously over my scalp for a few minutes. I find this is really helping with the itchiness. When I'm in the shower, I scrub my scalp under the hot water as if I'm washing my hair as usual. I'm not conditioning my hair shafts but I don't have any. I don't brush my hair because I've curly hair and it makes my hair frizzy. I've no idea if the water in the countries I visit have hard or soft water. I'm travelling through the middle East and Central Asia, with a single 40L bag, so I don't have a ton of space. 

I'm only 7 days in and I'm really feeling the grease. At the front of my head it's okay, but the back of my crown is flat with oil. Luckily I'm in a country that requires me to wear a headscarf but this won't be the case in a few days. I'm not at home so when I go to a shop to buy conditioner, I have no idea what I'm buying. The hair shafts are in good condition and I think I'm getting a good distribution of the oil through my hair, save for the back where it seems to be gathering. 

Now, I'm looking for some feedback on 2 fronts. How does my routine sound? How did you cope with the transition? Curly haired no poo people, how do you spread your hair's natural loveliness through to the ends without compromising your curl? Those who started when travelling, what did you do?

Finally, I Googled natural shampoos for SD and found WOW, an ACV shampoo on Amazon. Since my trouble was so immediate, I called my local beauty shop to see if they sold ACV shampoo and they didn’t, but suggested Whole Foods. I picked up Avalon Organics ACV shampoo and conditioner. 

I’ve been in Heaven since!! She shampoo is so cleansing and leaves my hair squeaky clean and the conditioner is so rich and creamy, my hair is just wonderfully soft.. and my hands, too!!! 

It’s all natural ingredients, no sulfates and other junk. I do have a little, tiny itch by my ears, so I might pre-treat with ACV/water mix before shampoo next time. Otherwise, my hair looks and feels great!!! Lots of body, no flyaways.. and, when I want to “go curly”, it’s not frizzy like it usually is.

My question however, is about the likelihood of getting reasonably healthy hair when I continue to bleach it. You see, my hair is a dull brown, and for a long time now I have had it coloured. Of course this has led to over-processing/dryness and general damage.

However, my hairline is starting to thin out and fall back like the crowd when it realizes there's no 2nd encore at the end of a concert.

I understand Rogaine can do this, but my understanding is you have to shampoo every day on that regimen.

3279,t3_bb633a,"Hi all,

I started nopoo ~4 months ago and I have very itchy scalp since 1,5 months.
When I was using industrial shampoo I also had this problem du to my very dry skin. I was shampooing every days and sometimes using one special shampoo for the itching and dry skin problem (like 3 special shampoo in a months).
Now my nopoo routine is once a week : 
- brown sugar massage
- almond oil (juste the tip of my fingers) + tea tree essential oil massage for 5 minutes
- shampoo with hot water, baking soda (half table spoon) and tea tree essential oil.
I established this routine thanks to the /r/nopoo wiki. My scalp is still very itchy and I often do a fast shampoo with hot water and tea tree essential oil in between shampoo instead of the hot water only. I wonder if I'm doing anything wrong ? Is it normal for the essential oil not to prevent itchiness during the whole week ?

By the way my hairs are short, my scalp is dry and the roots of my hairs can be oily but the tips are dry. I do no have dandruff, just dead skin du to the scratching...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a male with pretty short hair, but this sub has been very helpful for me.  

I've suspected for a long time that shampooing was the cause of my dandruff and scalp issues.  I washed every day with shampoo for 20+ years, then started backing off of it and only washing every other day, then twice a week.  I had minimal success. My hair looked better, but I still had bad dandruff and oil issues.  I've gone the past 5 weeks only shampooing once, and I'm really liking the results.  I use conditioner any time my hair feels like it badly needs a degreasing, but that hasn't even been once a week.  Aside from my forehead feeling more oily because of the hair, I'm mostly very pleased.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this: I get my hair cut every 4-5 weeks.  The stylist always shampoos and conditions my hair at the end, and it's one of my favorite parts (feels great obviously).  But it's also refreshing and I don't know if I want to tell her to stop.  What do you guys recommend? I am thinking of making that the only time my hair ever gets shampood (they use Nioxin with tea tree oil).  Then I go 4-5 weeks with no shampoo or conditioner.  Is this a decent strategy or am I asking for issues?

3343,t3_b15zpg,"I've been water-only for something like a year... been using hybrid boar bristle brushes for even longer. They are fantastic, I love them, but I hate cleaning them, and since the brush is basically responsible for cleaning your hair rather than shampoo, it really needs to be kept clean to work properly.

I have been tweaking my routine for a while. I used to shampoo the brush, but I was always low-poo (once a week or less) and this really wasn't enough, plus it was very hard on the brush.

I used a metal comb on my brushes for a long time, (I think this was also hard on them) and occasionally take a dental pick and run it through the individual bunches of boar hair (I still haven't found anything else that will really get the stuck lint out of the bristle clusters).

This year I switched away from the metal comb and bought a hairbrush cleaning tool, with thick plastic bristles. This doesn't go between as effectively as the comb, but if I brush the surface of the brush, it gets nearly all of the smaller hairs that don't come off by hand, and it loosens the dust for the final stage... which is an electric duster (meant to replace compressed air cans for cleaning the computer).

So the hairbrush cleaner, plus air-blast approach seems to be working okay for me as a daily cleaning solution, with occasional deep cleaning by dental pick... it feels ridiculous to put so much thought/effort into maintaining a hairbrush, but when I slack off on it, I end up removing dust tangles from my hair... not to mention using a hairbrush that looks like the inside of a vacuum bag... *sigh*",NoPoo

3346,t3_b12b6m,"Hey guys, first post here! A little background info before I get into it: I have extremely fine, slightly wavy, high-porosity hair that is very prone to splitting and breakage. I wash my hair once every 1.5 weeks with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, but I am trying to extend these stretches and eventually transition to no-poo. I do not wet my hair between washes. I also have an extremely sensitive scalp, and I had sebborheic  dermatitis and exczema as a child, which I grew out of. 

I am fairly certain I have hard water and am aware that water only is not an option for me. At about the 1 week mark of no washing, my scalp becomes extremely sensitive and painful to the touch, and I can barely tie it up or even part it. I have tried brushing my hair with a natural bristle brush as well as massaging my scalp with my fingertips, but it hurts so bad I can barely do more than a few minutes before I have to stop.

I use aloe vera twice a week overnight and rinse with apple cider vinegar (acv). Any other time in the week that I need to get rid of any oily hair (doesn’t happen often) I rinse with acv. 

I still blow dry and straighten with a hot brush. 

I also brush my hair every morning and night with a boar bristle brush for about 5 minutes. My shoulder length hair is growing fast, and the hair I lost from the SD seems to be growing back. 

I color my hair to cover grays, and the color doesn’t sting my scalp any longer and since I’m a redhead and color red/auburn, it’s no longer brassy. My hair takes the color and it’s a beautiful auburn that looks so natural no one can tell I’ve colored even5 minutes after I’m done.

I wash about twice a week with about 1/2-1 tsp baking soda and rinse with a splash of white vinegar. I felt like my hair was doing great - until I took a bath a week ago, which is something I don't usually do. I did my normal wash routine but in the bath (there was no soap in the water). Afterwards, I put a small pump of argon oil in my wet hair as it was feeling a bit dry. I then proceeded to get about 4 inches cut off my hair.

I didn't let the stylist use any products on my hair. But after it dried my hair was - well, it's hard to describe. Almost sticky?..I can't run my fingers through it anymore. And, overall, it's just looking bleh. 

I thought maybe somehow washing it in the bath messed it up (I have no idea how, but just trying to make some sense of it!).

Currently I have been using Everyday Shea shampoo and conditioner with an ACV rinse.

I keep my conditioner away from that area and only use ACV, but it’s not enough. I also have a mild/noticeably flaky scalp, depending on the day. So how can I have dry skin and oily hair?

3360,t3_axo86g,"Hey all, I've been basically shampoo free for about 9 years. I wanted to offer some thoughts and advice, because I have seen lots of posts by people just starting, or who have done it for a year or two, but not much from people like me, who've done it many years.

First, my qualifications. I first heard of the notion of not using shampoo a long time ago, and thought it made sense, so figured I'd try it. Worst case scenario it didn't work and I'd go back to shampooing every other shower. It did work, and I haven't stopped. I've had everything from shoulder length hair to buzz cut, so I have experience with varying lengths.

I say I've been basically shampoo free, because I will still occasionally use shampoo. I do a lot of projects, woodworking, tinkering on my old lawn tractor, brickwork/masonry, and other messy hobbies. Every once in a while, my hair gets too dirty for just water, and I will use shampoo. I have used shampoo probably no more than 4-6 times in the past 9 years. I am not opposed to using shampoo when it is needed, I just am not using it on a constant basis.

My routine is straightforward. I don't have extremely oily hair, which may be from not using shampoo for so long. I generally shower every 2-4 days on average, depending on the weather and my activity level. Summer I may shower every day, in winter when I'm not leaving the house, it may be 4-5 days. I know, that is along stretch to go between showers. I'm a stay-at-home dad of four young kids, and some weeks I don't do enough to warrant showering more often. I smell myself before my wife does, and she tells me if she ever smells me. Don't judge...

Anyway, when I shower, usually in the evening, I get my head under the water and scrub my hair and scalp with my fingernails. I use my nails to exfoliate my scalp, and use my fingers to wash out anything that might have gotten in my hair. I'm not talking about scratching my scalp till it hurts or bleeds, just giving it a good scalp massage/scratch. When I get out, I towel dry, and will give it a quick comb if it's long enough. That's it. No egg yolks, mayo, yogurt, baking soda, vinegar, etc...

Now, I've seen a lot of posts saying their hair is 'oily', and I'm not really sure what the posters mean. When I run my hands through my hair, there will be a slight feeling of oil on my hands. That is normal. That is what hair does. It makes some oil to protect the hair shafts from drying out, and keep the hair healthy and voluminous. We want that oil, which is why we stop stripping our hair with shampoo.

It is very similar to the coating of oil on a cast iron pan. If you are unfamiliar with this notion, it is like this. After using a cast iron pan, you want to put a thin coating of oil on the iron to protect the pan. Most people will pour a little oil in the pan, then use a paper towel to wipe out the excess oil. When finished, there are not pools of oil in the pan, just a nice, even, thin sheen. If you rub your palm across the pan, your palm will also have a thin coating of oil. Thin enough that you could probably just rub it in your hands like lotion and it would disappear.

Similarly, if you run your hands through your hair, you will feel a small amount of natural oils on your fingers. To me it feel like that very last bit of lotion that gets trapped between your fingers, and you have to get your thumb or other fingers down at the base to get it out. That's what my hands feel like after running my fingers through my hair, and that is not 'oily hair' that is natural hair.

I do not generally need hair products, gels, hair spray, or the like, because generally my hair is short enough I don't need it. When I do need it though, I will use it. I don't change my routine to get it out either. I may spend just a few more minutes washing my hair to get it all out. Generally though, natural hair shouldn't be bothered by hair products, unless you are using them to excess.

If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer as best I can.

TLDR: I've been doing this a long time, you (frankly) probably don't need many of the ""alternatives"" that are pushed, and some oil in your hair is normal and nothing to be worried about.",NoPoo

3362,t3_axl8uv,"Hi! I've been happily no poo for over 2 years now. I use Hesh powders (Aritha, Shikakai, Amla, Brahmi and Rose) to clean my hair once a week, then put coconut oil on regularly to moisturise. I have very curly hair with a tendency to get quite dry, this has improved greatly since I've stopped using shampoo and started going all natural. I normally DIY the products I use but these conditioner bars sounded interesting for when I go travelling in the spring.

However they have a couple ingredients I'm not sure about Cetyl alcohol and BTMS. I've googled them and they seem harmless but I wondered if anyone had any more information or opinions on these ingredients. I wouldn't want to ruin the progress I've made with my hair but I could do with some more hydration.

Exactly 80 days ago I used conventional shampoo for the last time.
I have been washing my hair with baking soda and rinsing it with ACV afterwards. About 10 times in total during those 80 days.

My hair is very fine, about butt length and gets greasy very soon. If I wanted to have nice looking hair, I would have to wash it daily.
This is the main reason I descided to do nopoo. The greas is overkill!

However, now, 80 days later, the grease is still as it used to be. I wash it and less than 24 hours later it is very very greasy again.

I have gotten used to it, wear it in a bun or with a scarf, so I don't mind. But I expected a faster adaptation, to be honest.

I am not thinking about giving up, though. I'm going to continue with this, as my hair looks better overall, has less split ends and the maintenance is the cheapest ever.


Maybe you guys could give me some tips on how to get my hair to produce less grease, some insight into how long it can take and so on.

Recently I was made aware how damaging both 1) washing your hair every day, and 2) the amount of chemicals in these products can be to your hair.

On top of this, I have sobria on my face (my whole family has it, even though all of our diets are very different), so my skin is already extremely dry. I’ve had to put aveeno lotion on my face every day to stop peeling/redness. Since I grew a short beard, with these dry skin problems it means I’m also battling endless beard dandruff/flakes, Which I am able to keep at bay most of the time by rubbing aveeno into the skin beneath my beard. (I’ve tried beard oils, and mixing coconut oil products with Argan oils and have not found anything that has worked besides aveeno).

Silver lining...

I will not be returning to washing my hair everyday regime. I no longer have dandruff issues. I no longer am relying on Ciclopirox/Stieprox Shampoo (saving money here! I chucked it in the garage) and learned to eat slightly less. I found that the more I eat, the more my scalp produced more oil and grease on my head. I learned that I had anemia from issues with my ovaries. My hair is growing back mainly because of the iron supplements. If the No-Poo did contribute to my recent hair growth, it wasn't visibly significant (I wasn't really keeping track of hair growth patterns. Sorry guys).

3382,t3_aveatm,"Hi--

I am a female with hair almost to my butt, definitely at my waist. My hair type is pretty much straight and fine, though I have a lot of hair. I am Polish, so I have the typical dark blonde/light brown color naturally that is getting darker with the oiliness--which I don't mind! My question is, on day 11 of water only, how much longer can I expect to have such nasty oily hair? It isn't terrible, I can pull it off with my hair in a bun or low pony tail, but the color change combined with the added weight is making it obvious. I'm down to power through it, but I would like to hear form others who had similar experiences how long this phase lasted.

&amp;#x200B;

My current routine (though I'm modifying as needed as I learn):

AM: 

\-slept with hair in a long plait/braid, used wide tooth comb to get any knots out

\-used boar brush with my head flipped over, then did an extra pass on my ends to make sure the oil gets down the long length

\-put it in a bun because I look like a sea monster

PM:

\-shower with a cap on

\-same brush routine as the AM, but I spritz a tea tree/peppermint essential oil toner (that I made) on my scalp to keep the flakes and funk at bay (I'm really happy with how this is working out)

\-usually braid it or toss it into a topknot to sleep

\-LAST NIGHT ONLY: did a water only rinse for the first time, my hair seemed like it was drying well then I put it in a bun when it was 90% dry (hoping for some easy waves in the morning, when I used shampoo this was my go-to), when I woke up my hair was noticeably less oily looking. Felt about the same, but it looked better. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main questions are how much longer until my scalp re-calibrates and how often should I do water only rinses? Will 2 days in a row be too often?

I heard finasteride helps with hair loss but has bad side effects like ED/limp dick.  I also heard Rogaine works great but if I stop I'd lose the hair grown from it within 3-6 months.

Hey there,

So I recently came across lots of posts about people's journeys and I thought I'd actually contribute, since certain groups of us run into the same problems and it's also nice to hear what others think and to have direct advice. Since I'm new to this subreddit, let me know if I should correct anything (format, etc.)

Hair: shoulder-length, straight and very dark (Asian), on the finer side but I do have a lot of it, so I have a pretty full head of hair. 

I tried giving up on shampoo a few years back and used a honey/ cinnamon mix once every week. My hair was so dead and grey that I gave up after 6 weeks and tried using a natural shampoo bar that was also meant to be used once a week, but it felt waxy and didn't change the fact that my hair felt dense and heavy, and there was a lot of build-up. This was all due to hard water, and since I didn't want to invest in a filter, I just went back to cheap and crappy shampoo.

Due to me picking up a sport, I started washing my hair every day, and I knew it was so bad for it. Bear in mind that my hair has always looked okay on the outside. The only aesthetic issue I had was that, due to all the washing, my hair would get so greasy very quickly. Then I started to think about how much I was wasting as well as the fact that constant shampooing is genuinely something that was recently deeply drilled into us as a necessity, when in fact (in the greater scheme of things) it isn't. 

So, I decided to try again.

Firstly, I slowly cut down the length of time between washes (every other day for 2 weeks, every 3 days for 2/3 weeks, twice a week for 2 weeks, then I stopped)

1st 2 weeks of no poo: green tea to ""scrub"" my scalp and hair, followed by black tea as a rinse (I think I read somewhere that the former was alkaline and the latter acidic and I thought I could achieve a 5.5ish pH balance) and just normal hard water to wash it out at the end.

This was perfectly good, since I used a boar bristle brush every night, that I also regularly cleaned. I washed my hair twice a week and it still had a good amount of volume. However, there was still build-up in my hair and towards the end of the second week, my hair started getting dense and grey again.

Very unhappy, I looked into managing that and found that making my acidic rinse more acidic (with lemon juice) should help. And it really did! My hair is no longer waxy, but on the other hand it is far too conditioned; it gets oily really quickly (within a day), though the oil is well distributed throughout the hair. So I reduced the amount of lemon (1 squeezed lemon in about 700ml of black tea instead of two), and this is my third day of oily hair, but oily in a manageable sense.

At the moment, I don’t really want to buy a water filter for my showerhead, but I do use my parents’ filter jug and then boil the water for the tea. Do you think I should go back to limiting the amount of days between washes gradually, or that I should reduce the amount of lemon in the black tea? Also, is saltwater (I use dead sea salt solution to treat my eczema) good for making hair a less oily? Or will that also encourage your scalp to overproduce?

Though I had a bit of a hiccough with the hard water, I do really believe that the lemon helped a huge amount. My boar bristle brush has barely any grey fluff/ waxy bits from brushing my hair, and I feel like my hair is at least evenly oily, instead of greasy at the roots and dry at the ends.

When it comes to how my hair looks, a couple of people have commented on how it looks healthier, but bear in mind that this no poo journey is the only time I’ve properly cared for my hair. From about 12 until 20, I didn’t even own a hairbrush (though my hair was midway down my torso at one point) and I never cared about how it looked, other than if it was too greasy – so I never, ever used conditioner, though in hindsight that probably would have made my head less oily. So now that I brush my hair daily, of course I’m crazy glad not to find my hair everywhere at home, but I don’t know if I’m just shedding it all into my brush, given that I never used to brush my hair. Also, even though I used to dye and bleach my hair a lot, I refused to use a hairdryer out of principle (my mum keeps telling me that going outside with wet hair will give me a cold, so I’ve been doing it in even -5 Celsius just to prove her wrong – successfully, may I add), so I don’t think my hair was that damaged beforehand.

I just really hate how we’ve been tricked into believing that shampoos are this giant necessity and then we go through our entire adult lives forced to shell out money and contribute to waste to avoid having “dirty” hair. Even if the no poo thing doesn’t work out in the long run, I really hope never to go back to washing my hair more than twice a week, and definitely not every day!

tl; dr: Asian hair, no poo with hard water for 3 weeks, at first using green tea followed by black was fine, but it did nothing for my build-up and so I added lemon juice to the black tea and now my hair gets greasy very easily, albeit evenly so and at least without the nasty waxiness from hard water.

My crown is pretty oily, but the rest of my hair is starting to feel very soft. I do get a little bit of static lift on the ends, however.
I brush in all directions, about 100 strokes every night. I have only washed twice thus far, both times soaking in a bath in the hopes that some of my flakes will float free, and then followed with a shower and COLD rinse to seal the cuticle.

1. I don't understand how to clean my boar bristle brush. It looks DISGUSTING after I brush; ashy and waxy.
2. I have a lot of flakes that will not come out of my hair. I ""scritch and preen"", but it just seems to make more. I cannot tell if it is dandruff or dry scalp because the flakies stick to my sticky, oily hair. How do I get rid of them?
I had this problem when I did regular washing before, and even when I shaved my head I still had flakes!
I have tried ACV rinse, and always felt as if it never came out of my hair completely. Like it was a layer or something.

3401,t3_assc8e,"Hey all, I've been basically shampoo free for about 9 years. I wanted to offer some thoughts and advice, because I have seen lots of posts by people just starting, or who have done it for a year or two, but not much from people like me, who've done it many years.

First, my qualifications. I first heard of the notion of not using shampoo a long time ago, and thought it made sense, so figured I'd try it. Worst case scenario it didn't work and I'd go back to shampooing every other shower. It did work, and I haven't stopped. I've had everything from shoulder length hair to buzz cut, so I have experience with varying lengths. 

I say I've been basically shampoo free, because I will still occasionally use shampoo. I do a lot of projects, woodworking, tinkering on my old lawn tractor, brickwork/masonry, and other messy hobbies. Every once in a while, my hair gets too dirty for just water, and I will use shampoo.  I have used shampoo probably no more than 4-6 times in the past 9 years. I am not opposed to using shampoo when it is needed, I just am not using it on a constant basis. 

My routine is straightforward.  I don't have extremely oily hair, which may be from not using shampoo for so long.  I generally shower every 2-4 days on average, depending on the weather and my activity level.  Summer I may shower every day, in winter when I'm not leaving the house, it may be 4-5 days. I know, that is along stretch to go between showers. I'm a stay-at-home dad of four young kids, and some weeks I don't do enough to warrant showering more often.  I smell myself before my wife does, and she tells me if she ever smells me. Don't judge...

Anyway, when I shower, usually in the evening, I get my head under the water and scrub my hair and scalp with my fingernails. I use my nails to exfoliate my scalp, and use my fingers to wash out anything that might have gotten in my hair. I'm not talking about scratching my scalp till it hurts or bleeds, just giving it a good scalp massage/scratch. 
When I get out, I towel dry, and will give it a quick comb if it's long enough. That's it. No egg yolks, mayo, yogurt, baking soda, vinegar, etc...

Now, I've seen a lot of posts saying their hair is 'oily', and I'm not really sure what the posters mean. When I run my hands through my hair, there will be a slight feeling of oil on my hands. That is normal. That is what hair does. It makes some oil to protect the hair shafts from drying out, and keep the hair healthy and voluminous. We want that oil, which is why we stop stripping our hair with shampoo.  

It is very similar to the coating of oil on a cast iron pan. If you are unfamiliar with this notion, it is like this. After using a cast iron pan, you want to put a thin coating of oil on the iron to protect the pan. Most people will pour a little oil in the pan, then use a paper towel to wipe out the excess oil. When finished, there are not pools of oil in the pan, just a nice, even, thin sheen. If you rub your palm across the pan, your palm will also have a thin coating of oil. Thin enough that you could probably just rub it in your hands like lotion and it would disappear. 

Similarly, if you run your hands through your hair, you will feel a small amount of natural oils on your fingers. To me it feel like that very last bit of lotion that gets trapped between your fingers, and you have to get your thumb or other fingers down at the base to get it out. That's what my hands feel like after running my fingers through my hair, and that is not 'oily hair' that is natural hair. 

I do not generally need hair products, gels, hair spray, or the like, because generally my hair is short enough I don't need it.  When I do need it though, I will use it.  I don't change my routine to get it out either.  I may spend just a few more minutes washing my hair to get it all out. Generally though, natural hair shouldn't be bothered by hair products, unless you are using them to excess. 

If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer as best I can. 

TLDR: I've been doing this a long time, you (frankly) probably don't need many of the ""alternatives"" that are pushed, and some oil in your hair is normal and nothing to be worried about. ",NoPoo
3402,t3_asrhir,"I went no 'poo a few years ago, in my late 20s, and immediately jumped straight to the bs/acv method. This worked for a couple years and then my hair went...bleh. I've always had very long hair (sometimes I can sit on it, though now I keep it more waist-length), average thickness (my braid is not quite as wide as my wrist, if that helps) and very soft. But with the baking soda once a week and boar bristle brushing every night, it wound up impossibly dry and unmanageable right after washing, passable the next day and downhill greasy the rest of the week. Even coconut oil wasn't helping. 

I switched back to shampoo, using sulfate-free ones with 'cone-free conditioners. I've tried several times in all this to go water only, the usual method being to gradually top the shampoo bottle with water. This always works great until I've used up the very last of the suds, then no amount of standing under the water and scrubbing and brushing does anything. My hair takes hours to dry on its own, anyway, and I usually give up and hit it with the blowdryer just to confirm what I already knew: the hard water left it greasy and waxy. On the rare occasions I've been somewhere with soft water, like on vacation, I've had the same grease problem without the wax. I'm currently using Carol's Daughter, which is price-y, but the results are great. 

I still follow my conditioner up with a rinse made of ACV and distilled water to remove buildup, but can't go more than 3 days without washing. I've also tried WO with ACV and still had the greasy problem. 

Now, I'm a full-time, stay-at-home aunt (for a sister who works at a daycare she can't afford), and I've been using my toddler niece and nephew for hair experiments since I'm invariably the one available at bath time. Previously, they'd both been using a hypoallergenic sulfate shampoo twice a week and a bit of my 'cone free vo5 conditioner, but one day I decided to go water only. 

Results: Niece, age 4, who has very fine shoulder-length hair with a slight wave, is able to up to a week without even rinsing, and it still doesn't look greasy. ACV, however, leaves it a bit limp. 

Nephew, age 2, extremely thick curly hair that hangs to his shoulders when wet is also able to go a week between rinses, ACV once a month helps combat any small amount of buildup that might be hiding in there and keeps his scalp smelling fresh. 

Again, we have hard water but neither of them are having any problem staying clean. Is this just an age thing because I started it so early on them and it's just too late for me, or is there some other trick I haven't tried?

3417,t3_apxun2,"Hi All,

I have been reading a lot if posts about dandruff/flakes/dry and itchy scalp/ Seborrheic dermatitis and even hearing IRL from friends and family. I decided to make this post so it could help others too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I was diagnosed with  Seborrheic dermatitis 4-5 years ago and it was BAD! I tried everything - prescription strength shampoo, drugstore shampoo, natural remedies like ACV, lemon juice etc, monistat anti-fungal cream, 8-9 kinds of oils, washing hair daily, washing hair weekly, shampoo bars etc. You get get the idea. 90% of these remedies did nothing, the other 10% worked but either left my hair as dry as a straw or stopped working after a few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I was utterly desperate and mentioned my problem to my massage therapist in Jan 2018. I have TMJ and get medical massage for head/neck/jaw area and I was super embarrassed to go to my therapist and have her rub her hands all over my nasty scalp. I told her about my problem and requested that she use gloves. She then mentioned that she studied Rosemary in her natural healing class and people swore by it.

 Being desperate, I tried it as instructed by her and voila! It worked! Instructions below.

1. Buy dried rosemary (online or whole foods).
2. Bring 3 cups of filtered water to a boil.
3. Add 2-3 tsp rosemary, preferably in a teabag/stainless steel tea ball thingy and reduce to the heat to a simmer.
4. Simmer the tea/rinse for 20-30 min.
5. Turn off the stove and let the rosemary steep, covered, for a few hours (optional for max efficacy).
6. Remove the rosemary and transfer the liquid to a spray bottle for easy application. Please use an amber/dark blue glass bottle (cheap on Amazon) to safely store the volatile oils/compounds in the rinse.

How to use: Use it all the time until you get rid of the flakes.

1. I use as a pre-wash treatment - spray all over scalp and hair liberally. It should saturate the scalp especially. I wait 30-60 min or even overnight depending oh how well I plan my day.
2. I also use it as a post-wash rinse - pour the rinse all over the hair in the shower post-wash as the final step. Rinse with water.
3. I also use it as leave-in - spray the scalp liberally and lightly on the hair after you get out of the shower on damp hair.
4. I use as needed on dry hair if I feel itchy. Simply spray on scalp and leave in.

FYI - I double the recipe and store in the fridge with a couple spoons of vodka in the rinse as a mild preservative. It usually keeps for 2 weeks.

I have been doing this for a year and my scalp is so healthy and flake-free. I did a very intensive daily treatment for 2 weeks to get my scalp under control and now I am at maintenance - usually a weekly application. The other great thing is the side-effects have been all positive - less frizz, skin looks fab because I usually also spritz my face with it. 

I bought a large 1 LB bag of organic Rosemary from Mountain Rose Herbs a year ago (no affiliation) and I still have a ton left. I am thrilled. This solution is so cheap, easy and safe. 

Variations: After telling everyone about this, my friends and family have reported back with their own recipes and all of them have worked well. See below:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Using fresh rosemary also works great. My friend lives in a warm climate and grows rosemary all year round in her yard. 
2. Not simmering or steeping - my cousin lives in a dorm at college and doesn't have a stove to do this. She simply microwaves water in large mug, adds the rosemary and tosses the tea bag 10-15 min later. She doesn't transfer it to a bottle either, she just dumps the entire mug on her head in the shower. 
3. The quantity is very forgiving - some use less/more. Still works.

Anyway, I hope this helps someone. Buy a small packet and try it. As mentioned above, I got a proper diagnosis for SD from a dermatologist, who funnily enough, laughed at this cure when I asked her before trying. Oh well, just happy it worked for me.

EDIT : how often should i wash/wet my hair per week?",NoPoo
3425,t3_aoydry,"### My routine:
I use water only, cold when I'm in a place with hard water and hot when I'm somewhere with soft water (or somewhere with hard water that doesn't cause hair problems – more on this below). I scrub my hair and scalp pretty vigorously for a few minutes, as if I were using shampoo. I wash my hair like this every day. I don't use a brush or comb at all. My hair is short (&lt;1-5""). I've been doing water-only for about 4 years.

I eased into water-only by slowing using more and more ""natural"" hair products over the course of a few years. So I used normal shampoo -&gt; natural shampoo -&gt; baking soda -&gt; water only + occasional shampoo/baking soda to deal with hard water -&gt; water only. I never had a transition phase.

### Hard water
Hard water contains various, depending on region, dissolved minerals. The dissolved minerals bind to sebum to make really unpleasant sticky, white, waxy buildup. It can make your hair feel and look stiff and wet. It's not clear which minerals cause these problems (although my best guess is calcium). I've lived in various places with hard water and only some of them caused the stiffness/stickiness problem.

You should be able to look up your water hardness online. Your water utility [US] is required to make water testing data available, which includes info about dissolved mineral content. There are also maps that highlight regions with soft/hard water. However, keep in mind that the cutoff for hard water is subjective. The real measure of water hardness is if your water is causing you any hair problems. If you're rinsing/washing with water only and your hair starts to develop sticky white stuff, then you have hard-enough water.

I've found that this can be alleviated (amazingly!) by washing exclusively with cold water. It really does work :) When I switched to using cold water, my waxy buildup problems went away in a week of washing every day, so, 7 washes. So you should be able to tell in a short period of time whether cold water is working for you.

Sebum melts around 91°F (33°C). I hypothesize that when it melts the dissolved minerals in hard water get trapped and make that sticky white residue. Hence, if you wash with water cooler than 91°F, your sebum won't soften and won't get minerals mixed in with it.

### What you should do
First, see if you actually have this buildup problem with water-only. Like I said above, in my experience there are a lot of places with supposedly hard water that don't cause problems for me (maybe due to high dissolved minerals, but low dissolved calcium?).

If you *do* have buildup problems, you can address it in various ways:

* Wash with cold water.
* Wash with rain water.
* Wash with distilled water, not tap water.
* Use a shampoo or shampoo alternative every once in a while (every 2 weeks-2 months) to take out the mineral buildup, and do water-only for your day-to-day washes.
* Rinse with something acidic (vinegar is popular, lemon juice and citric acid should both work too). (I haven't tried this myself, but some people say it works.)
* Get a water softener system or water-softening shower head (some contain vitamin C that you have to replenish every so often). (I haven't tried this myself, but some people say it works. I've also seen some websites claim that shower heads can't soften water – they don't have enough contact time with it, basically.)

Lastly, if you're just starting off, I wouldn't worry about this stuff right now. Getting through the transition phase is the first struggle. Once that's done, if you're still having hair problems (dandruff, buildup, dryness, etc etc), look into different shampoo alternatives/changes to your routine to address those specific problems. I didn't even realize hard water was a problem until 1.5 years into low 'poo.",NoPoo

3427,t3_aojhcf,"One month in, no shampooing!

Okay backstory: my hair was falling at an alarming rate after shampooing. I had an itchy, scratchy scalp. Insane dandruff! Insane!
I was trying all sorts of oils and shampoos but nothing worked either for the itch/dandruff or for the hairfall. Then i found out about how shampoos rob our scalp of natural oils.

January 8th was the last time i oiled/shampooed my hair.

Now many here are doing only water which i dont think is right. Just Water cant remove grime. I wash my hair two or three times a week. Once with just water. Once an egg mask. I apply 2-3 egg yolks on my scalp and keep for half an hour. Then i rinse with cold water. I also do a yogurt mask once a week. (I told this to someone here earlier and he thought it was a joke, but it’s not.) Hung curd is basically plain yogurt drained of all water. You dont want to apply yogurt without draining the water else it would keep dripping all over your face. You can use a muslin cloth to do that. Apply for 30, wash with cold. Hair feels amazing. Of course, you gotta use plain yogurt not black fucking currant.

Now because of all these organic applications your head might smell a bit so take half a lemon, squeeze it in a bowl and once you’ve rinsed off the mask apply that lemon juice on your scalp. Keep it for a minute and then wash with cold. Think of it like a conditioner. Another great conditioner is onion juice. Will remove any smells and helps with dandruff too. Plus the sulfur in it is supposed to encourage hair growth.

My hairfall has reduced significantly. I’m no longer scratching my head like an idiot. The dandruff is still there but i would say it has gone down by half, at least. One last thing, switch to a wooden comb. Plastic combs generate static while brushing and our hair stick to the teeth and break away. No such problem with wooden combs.",NoPoo

My dry scalp has been awful for a long time, and the dry environment I live in doesn't help. Exfoliating hasn't helped much, and I found most exfoliants needed to be shampooed out so I couldn't use them often anyway. I noticed my scalp behaved better after hair masks so figured adding moisture would be a good idea. I finally decided to try making a small spray bottle with a blend of:

* some fresh aloe gel (none of the yellow juice from the peel, just the clear gel from inside, and I used a leaf's worth so about 2tbsp but I'm going to start buying a pure gel so I don't kill my plant lol, recommendations welcome)
* good, clean witch hazel (a couple ounces or so)
* a bit of water (probably 3 ounces ish)

The exact proportions don't seem to matter much, for my personal results anyway.

After each wash but before applying leave-in conditioners/serums, I shake up the spray, divide my hair, and drench the hell out of my roots/scalp with it, then massage it in a bit. The very first time I used it, it did wonders for my dry scalp starting INSTANTLY! I also realized quickly that it seems to help control oil production, too, and I went from needing to co-wash about three times a week to only needing to do it once a week. That also happened essentially instantly!

I also started spraying it on (more lightly though, sometimes just on the really itchy/flaky areas) every day on dry hair, not just after washes. So far, I have never yet hit a point where this mixture dried heavily or left residue on my head, and I've put on a LOT of it at a time/over days. I have very fine strands, a fair bit of volume but the strands are super fine and get weighed down easily, so I think if this is drying down clean/weightless on me (especially going a week of uses at a time!) then it should probably do so on just about everyone.

I've been using this for about a month now. My dry scalp isn't totally gone but it's radically better than it was, the itching is a million times better, and the oil control benefit has stayed steady. One time when I didn't have aloe I just used the witch hazel, and the oil production stayed low but the flakes were more present; another time I didn't have witch hazel and just used the aloe, and that time the flakes were better but the oil production moved a bit more toward my-old-normal that week. Take from that anecdotal evidence what you will, and invent something that's perfect for you!

I'm really amazed by how easy this is, how well it works, and how cheap it is, and I really wish I'd tried it years ago. I reallyreallyreally hope this idea helps people out there. As far as I'm concerned, this tool should be in everyone's toolbox!",NoPoo

I started the no poo method in late July of last year and after a couple weeks of having very oily/waxy texture, my hair transitioned into a desirable texture that felt very clean with a minimal but still present amount of oil that allowed me to style my hair.

My hair is very fine, and straight. I am white. No dandruff while using shampoo.

* 27 days without touching a shampoo bottle, aaauuugggh. Since then I've been WO, and keeping my hair up in a ponytail on oily days. Which is most of the time.
* Scalp is still in oily phase but seems to have started producing less of it on its own. I'm not sure if I'm imagining it, or if I'm just used to the oiliness by now.
* Scritching **definitely** produces less oil from about two weeks in. First time I scritched, my hair went from completely clean to soaked and gross in less than a minute. Now it doesn't overreact any more.
* I kept thinking I wasn't distributing the oils down to my ends because my ends always felt dry, but after brushing charcoal residue through my hair that one time (to try reduce odor) and finding it completely soaking the brush it became pretty clear that yes, the oils really *do* stick to the brush very easily, and should therefore be sticking to my ends too.
* A week later I discovered ""hair dusting"", a method to reduce split ends without losing length. Found out that my ends aren't dry -- **the feeling of dryness came from split ends**. Dusting them significantly reduced the dry feeling.
* Been having odor problems for ten days. **It's definitely a bad smell.** So I've been WO washing my hair often the last week to try and keep it under control without resorting to charcoal, baking soda or shampoo -- at most I can only reduce it.
* Scalp started itching a week in, went down at about the three week mark.
* Had dandruff from about a week in -- it doesn't flake off the scalp when I scratch it, it's just there. When I see it I dig the BBB out.
* Today I found some tea tree oil spray at Coles so I sprayed my scalp and BBB, and had a good scritch and distributed it through my hair. Still slight smell, but a significant amount was reduced.
* Going to keep up the tea tree each day for the rest of the oily phase. Hopefully, the smell will go when the oily phase does... not looking forward to what I should do if it doesn't. I don't want to wind up having to measure out baking soda/ACV or eggs or whatever it is non-WO no-poo people do; seems to defeat the entire point of going WO if I'm dealing with a huge hassle like that. IDK, I'll cross that bridge when I come to it!
* **Hair is softer**. Like. Really soft. In the last week it's actually been pretty silky.
* **Volume is reduced**. My hair has always been very fine, and never had volume -- I've always relied on shampooing it, and having it dry in certain positions for volume. Without shampoo it's very flat and thin.
* I know I should be grossed out but I find it hilarious that on my oiliest days, I can take out my pony tail and the pony tail will just... stay. These are high ponytails, btw, not nape-of-the-neck ones. It just stays and I can even swish it around and it'll just hold, omfg. I have to actually tousle my hair to get it out. It's hilarious because my hair used to never hold anything for shit.

I'll give another update in a week or two. Figured this might be useful for other people considering it, or still going through their own oily phases.",NoPoo
3460,t3_ajldmw,"So /u/weeblewobble82 wrote a comment in reply to [another post I made two weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/aerac4/wo_how_often_should_i_wash_my_hair_during_the/edv3t10/):

&gt;  The method I use in that case, is I wash the ends only and then use a boar hair bristle brush and my hands to distribute the oil from my scalp down the shaft.

(Context at link)

Wanted to put this forward for more discussion.

The method I'd read about how to wash WO is:

* Scritch
* Preen
* BBB
* Wash hair under shower by scritching scalp under warm water

So basically -- still washing the scalp and getting rid of oils.

But like, has anybody done it /u/weeblewobble82's way -- not just to try and reduce the oiliness during the oily phase, but as a WO habit to maintain post-oily phase? Instead of washing the scalp?

It seems to make sense to me that it might be a better idea to just leave the scalp alone entirely outside of scritching, and to preen under water instead of scritching. But I don't know if that contributes to odor or oiliness or what.

&amp;#x200B;

Like the title says I'm going no poo for the first time in my life. I (18 M) have thick curly hair and Im looking for a healthier curl. I bought maneline's shampoo, and after using for half a week my hair started to become very thick and leathery. I understand the adjustment phase and I have noticed that it feels ""healthy"" however it has so much weight to it, when it dries its just a big bushy mess ( especially If I run my hands through it)

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to know for the other curly hair redditors what your routines are/ what products you reccomend to make a light and free flowing curl that holds its moisture. My hair is also dry as can be 8/10 dryness. I linked the shampoo for those that are curious.

&amp;#x200B;

recently I have tried using and egg yolk to clarify my hair, and that worked really well to make it feel very clean, however it almost feels the same as if I used a shampoo

Routine: I get in the shower ( always look warm) I wet my hair and use a soft tipped scalp brush to massage a small amount of maneline shampoo evenly throughout my hair. I let that sit for 2-3minutes and then gently rinse it out while running my hands through it. I then either air dry or use a pillow case to slowly rub my hair dry. more recently I used a yolk to rinse out build up in my hair.

Goals: solid routine to get defined curls with minimal frizz. Going for soft flowing hair as well.

TLDR: looking for a good routine to get free flowing curl that holds its moisture. what products or home remedies do you recommend?

Been no-poo consistently for about 7 years now, currently using African Black soap. So cheap, use it for my body and my hair, and it's wonderful. I make it softer with coconut oil or my beauty store mango styling gel that has jojoba oil and the like in it. 

I've got black, coarse Asian hair, so not sure how much my methods would help people, but I really just went cold turkey. One of the few good things from my mother was her getting me to go no-poo, hence why its been 7 years. Originally, I just used bar soap, and with my short hair it worked. 

Started using black african soap last year, it's really nice and exfoliating. Have to be causeful not to get too sudsy or else it really burns in my eyes. Coconut oil is super good for making my hair soft, but it definitely looks greasy right after I put it on.

Am a guy, so not too concerned about how greasy or stylish I look, I went no-poo to save money and convenience. Gonna be no-poo for rest of my life probably, as it works well for me. ",NoPoo

The recipe starts with you mixing

° Rye Flour and Water

The ratio to mix it is 1:2 ( for every spoon of rye flour you add 2 spoons of water )

° Mix it fully until a liquid paste forms

° When washing leave it for a few minutes and then rinse until clean

° After that use Apple Cider to avoid dryness 

° At the end use a brush to remove any of the flour that is still on the hair

3478,t3_agwd6k,"I've always liked the idea, but am not convinced about the reality. I've been co-washing for a while and that's been working well, but would like to full on commit to water only.

However, I'm not convinced about the scientific basis of no poo. From what I've read, most proponents state that scalp starts producing less oil as it gets ""used"" to not being stripped of grease every few days. TBH, to me this sounds questionable (don't take this as an attack, I just think it's good  to challenge stuff). How would the skin cells and the hair follicle even monitor sebum levels?

**Is there any actual peer reviewed research into this, and where did the idea come from in the first place?**

Even if there's not and even if the above theory is wrong, that's less important than whether no poo works even for another reason.

Which brings me to question 2. All you people who have really nice hair from no poo; Is it actually ***nicer*** than when you used shampoo and conditioner, about the same, or worse but still fine? Because one of my friends has been ""no pooing"" for 6 years or so, and her hair looks fine. But it still sometimes looks a little waxy and greasy (especially now it's longer). So is your hair better than it was before? Or is no poo just a low maintenance way for hair to look OK.

Would super appreciate any insight!

On the website, they suggest doing a ACV rinse after using the shampoo bar.

Our plumbing in the house we are renting backs up if you look at it wrong, and the tub took a loooong time to drain out today.

To avoid shoving flour down our sensitive drain all the time, I was thinking about making some sort of tea. Like soak or cook the flour and use the liquid and not the solid. Do any of you do this? Cold soak or hot infusion? Do you put it on your head all watery or do you reduce it down to a thicker consistency? Do you feel it cleans as well as actual rye flour?

I feel like hot would get more of the good good out but my hair is loving the protein and I don't want to disturb the protein structures in the rye flour with heat. Also...would the water even have protein in it? I have doubts about it because of fake meat. Old school recipes for making seitan (a meat replacement) involve washing wheat flour in water. Repeated exposure to water removes any gluten until only the protein remains. Would this also be an issue? Like, would rye water be everything but the protein I want?

I have learned my hair feels best and looks best of I treat once every 1.5-2 weeks with 1tbls of baking soda in 1 cup water followed by 1tbls of ACV in 1 cup water.

Is this good? should I do this more or less frequently? should I not be doing this? Should I be doing anything else? I've also beeing taking biotin for about a month, for all the good its worth.

3510,t3_ad7uyy,"Hey NoPoo

I've been currently without soap about 3+ years now, using exclusively cold water on my hair for about a year. 

My guide to surviving the cold:
Start warm, but don't rinse your hair with hot water. ONLY use cold water in your hair. Warm water opens pores in your hair, allowing more adsorption of oils. Only using cold water will shock your hair, freeing oils more than usual. Water will get most of the oil out, and any excess should be taken up in a healthy amount once your hair warms up. When you scrub, rinse your hands often. NoPoo is a physical cleaning method and reducing oils on your hands makes it more effective. Use water as cold as you can go. It'll be rough at first, but if you stay consistent you'll get used to it. Cold showers are honestly very refreshing. 

As far as frequency, everyone is different. It will depend on your activity levels and experience with no shampoo. Pay attention to what you do each day and find what works. Personally, I will at least wet my hair daily but not necessarily scrub. 

If the cold is hard, start hot, alternate to cold when washing your hair, then back to warm before your toes fall off. But, ONLY cold water in your hair. Any amount of hot water can result in greasy hair at the end of your shower. 

Good luck, learn to love the cold. Cold showers are one of the best things I've found for energy, mental health, and immune system promotion.

Best,

- Juice from 1 lemon
- About a tsp Cinnamon

Place in a jar and let ferment on the counter for 1-2 days, then move to the fridge. After eating the apples, I dumped about a half cup of the 'brine' in my hair and worked it like shampoo.

What I came across recently is that some are doing the same thing with their entire body--which is, going soap-less.

I mean I would usually run a soapy washcloth between my cheeks a few times and then rinse. But I mean, I don't know.

How are you doing today?

So, I got some skin and hair problems ever since I can remember. When I was younger I didn't really care about hygien and it turns out that I grew up with a lot of pimples, blackheads and dandruff. 
This year when I decided to cut my long hair I realized that I was balding, and this process improved really fast through this year, it's terrifying. 
As you all probably know, commercial anti dandruff shampoos and skin care medicine didn't work at all. I went to the dermatologist and she said that I'm balding thanks to a condition called ""Dermatitis Seborrheic"", in other words my glands works too much, my body gets too oily and due to the lack of proper skin care it turns to be a really big problem. After researching I realised that it wasn't worth to take any of the tons medicine she asked me to buy and take - first because it's too expensive; second because they wouldn't solve the problem, just addict me (like anything in health industry nowadays). 
I decided to start taking cold showers and I am already used to it. I don't use any shampoos, but use conventional soaps to wash my body and head. After taking a shower, I apply apple cider vinegar and a tea of nettle, rosemary and cinnamon on my scalp and leave it. It works pretty good, my scalp isn't itching too much and no dandruff, but if I don't take a bath everyday the dandruff comes again and start itching a bit, but it isn't as bad as it used to be. 
I am trying a new diet, cutting the junk food as much as I can and taking vitamins and care more about nutrition. I also stated working out. 
PS: I'm just 18, that's why I am terrified.

Some background info: I have been low-poo for four years, using Dr. Organic Aloe Vera once a week. I have shoulder-length hair, straight and I would say it’s very healthy (no split ends and hardly ever dry).

I scritch, preen and BBB every day and keep my brush clean. I use microfibre cloth once a week. But my hair is still one greasy mess, from top to bottom.

3561,t3_a42dt7,"I have fine, curly hair, and lots of it. It’s especially curly around my face; the back is more thick and wavy. I’ve been washing with baking soda and rinsing with ACV (mixed with water) about twice a week, and using Badger brand hair oil mixed with rose water as a leave-in conditioner, all for about six months. 

My problem is that my hair looks like garbage every morning after I sleep on it, and the only surefire way to make sure it looks nice every day is by FULLY rinsing or washing. This is true whether I air dry or blow dry. If I rinse and let air dry, I have wet hair for the first half of the day, which doesn’t work when I work mornings. It’s very easy for it to become frizzy after air drying. If I mist with a spray bottle after waking up, my hair ends up frizzy beyond acceptability whether or not I run my fingers through; like, I may as well not have bothered.

If I have blow dried it smooth the previous day, then I wake up to cow licks that I can’t smooth out, even with a boar bristle brush. The brush may flatten the cowlick, but the ends of my hair will stay wavy, creating an equally weird texture that I end up wanting to pin back; again, why bother trying if I’m just going to cover it up?

When I was a naive youth, I used to wash and blow dry my hair EVERY SINGLE DAY for this reason. It has always been a challenge to make my hair look nice from day to day, and I’m tired of constantly cutting it short. I miss having a bob/longer hair, so I’m growing it out again with the hope that I will be able to treat it better this time around and keep it nice looking, and also that I’ll at least be able to pull it into a bun on days when I don’t have time to fuss with it. Still, I just wanna be pretty some days! 

So, now that I have some length again...does anyone with a similar hair type have any suggestions for everyday styling for fine curls when daily rinsing is not an option? 

I want to note here that I try to use minimal product to as to keep from having to wash more often. My fine texture can easily look greasy. ",NoPoo

I assume we don't have hard water because we have a whole house water softener but have never tested our water.  

My hair is thin and was 2C/3A with my old ways but has been much more straight since giving up conventional shampoo. (The exact opposite of what I had hoped for.)  

My current routine:  I wash with my shampoo bar, currently using ""Simply Shea"" by Apple Valley, and follow up with an ACV &amp; water rinse.  I've also started using about a dime size amount of conditioner in the ends of my hair along with an even smaller amount or Argan and Jojoba oils. On wash day my hair can have a lot of fly-aways and may even look frizzy.   Day 2 is hit or miss; sometimes my hair looks fine and other times my roots begin to look greasy.  By day 3 my roots are noticeably greasy.   Sometimes  I just braid it and deal, other times I use a homemade dry shampoo (corn starch and cocoa).   By day 4 I really struggle with whether to shampoo again or not. Sometimes the dry shampoo will get me 2 extra days, sometimes only 1 day.  I do notice that I can go a bit longer before my roots get greasy if I skip the ACV rinse.  I do have 2 boar bristle brushes that I've tried using.  It doesn't seem to make a huge difference and I'm not sure the oils are getting to the ends of my hair?  It's also been pretty rough on my curls.

I tried going water only but getting my hair wet seems to make it angry.  Even with lukewarm/cool-ish water it makes my roots immediately look more oily.

Looking for help and completely sick of my hair becoming greasy halfway through one day. Now I have been Water Only for two weeks running with no real need to use cleansing products at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

To preface, my hair is fine with a slight wave, and there is a LOT of it. I shed like crazy and currently it sits roughly at the bottom of my rib cage.

I always had heaps of trouble with my hair, in high school it was greasy on top with dry and splitting ends. If I washed it in the morning it would 100% be greasy by lunch time. It was infuriating for me. After some time complaining about it, my sisters friend said if I didn't wash it for 3 weeks and then went back to washing it normally it would be HEAPS easier. I thought this was great - in theory. Obviously I knew nothing about sulfates and silicones so it didn't make any difference, just that it was insanely oily for the three week duration.

So I went back to normal for some time, just washing it and dealing with the greasy and oiliness that went along with it. Until one day in my 20's I discovered reddit and this sub. I was so surprised it was an actual thing for people, let alone a possibility for me to maybe get to a point where I wouldn't need to wash my hair so much, which seemed completely unfathomable.

Anyway, I did some research and lurking of this subreddit and of course my first go to was baking soda and vinegar, which absolutely no idea about pH levels I just went ahead and did it. My hair texture changed, it became really thin and straight, it looked great for a while, until the baking soda started burning my scalp. Naturally I flipped and made my way back here for other alternatives, I came across rye flour.

Let me just say, Rye Flour is amaaaaaaazing. So good for you like, once a week, great protein for your hair. But I think I just found for me, it was unsustainable considering the length of my hair. But by this point, sticking to rye flour and especially no longer touching silicone conditioners, the length of time to washing my hair was increasing, bit by bit.

I was really happy, my hair was growing so well and it was great, it honestly still is but as I said, the upkeep with rye flour, the husk and potential damage to my plumbing was concerning for me. So after a few months, I looked to sulfate and silicone free shampoos and conditioners.

In my country, it's not so easily accessible and when you do find it, it is EXPENSIVE. I first tried [this](https://moogoo.com.au/milk-shampoo.html) along with the matching conditioner, it worked well and my hair grew like crazy. After a while though my scalp was getting really dry. I had started to learn a bit more about ingredients in shampoo and conditioner and realised it is full of coconut derivatives, which I don't think my skin agrees very well with. So again, I looked for another alternative.

I then found [this shampoo](https://www.akin.com.au/sensitive--scalp/p/mild-and-gentle-fragrance-free-shampoo-225ml/1310001.html?lang=en_AU#lang=en_AU&amp;start=1). Which is pretty much what I have been using for the past year. It has been so great, even though it's expensive for me, I only use it roughly once a week. It doesn't foam up much, but you don't necessarily need it to. Because of my dry ends, the conditioner was perhaps not enough to help with the splitting, but I changed to the deep conditioner, which easily fixed the issue. Also conditioner only with this product worked really well to my surprise.

Anyway, recently I have been between my two jobs, I start a new one soon. But I got really lazy and didn't wash my hair with anything but water. It's been two weeks and it actually looks really good. The only thing I've recently changed is my hairbrush to one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Brush-Cushion-Bristle-Handle-Brushes/dp/B00898E5O2) which has helped immensely with my split ends.

Anyway, if you're curious to know what gross disgusting foul greasy after half a day hair looks like after literal years of trial and error, to today with two weeks WO, here it is. Remember kids, persistence is key.

3625,t3_9rlxr3,"I have thin hair. My usual routine is to shampoo my hair every other day, and cover it with dry shampoo on days when I don't wash my hair. I recently started using lush bars, which I loved, but then realized they have sulfates, and now I am not sure I want to use them. I also have a giant bottle of livingproof shampoo, which I like. I also normally use a detangler, volumizing spray, heat protector, sometimes I use hair wax, and finish it off with hair spray.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a large forehead, so it is not easy for me to wear my hair up, because my forehead looks giant! Same goes for headbands, etc. I work out a lot, so I don't want to bother with bangs. When I had bangs, I had to wash it every day, and it was thinning out even more, so I gave up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I washed my hair normally as described above on Monday. Then I wanted to go swimming on Wednesday evening, so I didn't want to wash my hair on Wednesday morning, as I would normally do, and instead I just wore it up. It is not normal for me, and I didn't feel good the whole day. 

&amp;#x200B;

On Wednesday night I ended up not going swimming, and instead was reading about this subreddit and checking out some FAQs.I didn't want to have a weird transitioning period, since I am already very concerned about my face and my hair, and having greasy hair is not something I am ok putting up with. 

I already have a boar-bristle brush, so I was wondering, what would happen if I just wash my hair with warm water only, and condition. I was like.. well.. the worst thing that can happen, I will have to wash it again the next day, but it's worth a try. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I washed my hair thoroughly, massaging very well, then applied a tiny bit of conditioner, and made sure I rinse it well. To my surprise, my hair felt very clean, I didn't feel the difference comparing to using shampoo. And if you don't feel the difference, then why use it? I was shocked with the results. I noticed my hair was more shiny, but not oily. I also skipped the detangler (surprisingly my hair didn't feel like straw, so I didn't see the need), skipped the volumizing spray, and everything else. I just dried my hair with a hairdryer, and it felt really good all day. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the evening I swapped my silk pillowcase around to make sure it is clean, and combed my hair with the boar-bristle brush. I went to sleep without braiding my hair (hoping for that magical effect of a silk pillowcase). I brushed my hair thoroughly with the brush, and went to work. This is the first time I went to work with my second-day hair free of any products. I can definitely see reduced volume compared to yesterday, and I am definitely slightly concerned that by the end of the day my hair is going to look oily, but I am hoping for the best. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I just want to share, and if you guys have any tips or comments, feel free.

I learned these are cyclic silicones (or siloxanes) based on a [Naturally Curly article](https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/curlchemist-cyclomethicones-a-different-category-of-silicones) which also includes some mixed messages about build-up, e.g., ""Cyclomethicones... aren't prone to build-up"" and ""[consumer-reported] problems were attributed to build-up on the surface or build-up due to penetration of the smaller silicone into the hair shaft,"" then the author suggests the unfavorable results were due to a different mechanism.  

[Neonatural.com](http://www.nenonatural.com/hair-blog/-water-soluble-vs-non-soluble-silicones-found-in-hair-products) indicates Cyclohexasiloxane is only slightly soluble and Cyclopentasiloxane is not water soluble, indicating these are both likely to contribute to buildup.

3667,t3_9lixt5,"I'm about 2 weeks into my NoPoo journey. I have been CG for over a year, but decided to make the switch to NoPoo because of still greasy hair and a desire to reduce waste from lots of purchased hair products. After reading this sub, I researched and found out that my water is moderately hard. So my current routine is: wetting my hair with cold water, co-washing with Shea Moisture Restorative Conditioner, and rinsing with cold water. When I rinse with cold water, it makes my hair feel squeaky clean, like I've used a harsh shampoo even though I haven't. I hate this feeling, and I've been adding a bit of conditioner as a leave-in afterwards, even though I have to co-wash more frequently because I get oilier more quickly. Why does this happen?

3669,t3_9li4qk,"So I tried the curly girl method for a while and found it wasn't for me. Styling products always left my hair greasy and yuck feeling, and also took too much time.

Before trying CG I was using Dr Bronners soap bar on my hair, and the Dr Bronners conditioning rinse. I had good results until I decided to put blonde in my hair, which left it quite tangly after showers, so I went back to using conditioners to help with detangling.

It's been over a year since I had the blonde put in and I'm ready to try no poo again, but not the full CG method. I am too lazy.

All I can really tell you about my hair is that it's fine, low porosity and has henna in it now.

Can I go back to using Dr Bronners without drying out my hair? I found the liquid soaps more drying than the bar soap, which I didn't expect. Is Dr bronners damaging at all?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very new to the whole ""no 'poo"" thing (a bit over a week in), so I'm still on my first method which is applying a mask of bentonite clay, ACV, lavender essential oil, and water (enough to form a paste), every three days or so, rinsing with a diluted ACV rinse, and brushing with a BBB the days between.  

&amp;#x200B;

The bentonite clay honestly almost seems too good to be true - it leaves my hair soft, de-tangled, and not overly greasy.  Has anyone else been doing this long term?

I heard about No Poo and without really doing any research just decided to stop using shampoo, conditioner or styling products in my hair. I do pretty much nothing to it except rinse it with hot water and towel dry it into a rough messy style. I've always kept my hair pretty short and this process has served me well. However, I've grown it a bit longer now (apparently having newborn twins doesn't leave much time for things like haircuts), and instead of just lopping most of it off, I want an actual hairstyle. If you Google ""male haircut short sides long top"", pretty much any of the image results are what I'd be aiming for.

My problem is that when my hair is a bit longer, it gets kind of fluffy, voluminous and difficult to control. It doesn't *feel* too dry, but it kind of looks it, I guess. I think my individual hairs are quite fine and wiry, I just have a lot of them, if that makes sense. My hair's not curly, but once it gets a bit longer it's also definitely not straight by any measure.

What can I do to tame it into my desired style? I've loved the feeling of not having any wax or gel in my hair and am reluctant to go back to using some kind of styling product, although I'm open to recommendations if that's the way I have to go.

I had been attempting NoPoo for several years with mixed results in the quality of my hair. I'm also quite active and regularly workout and also work in a hospital and am likely colonized by MRSA. 

During this time I developed a true chronic folliculitis in my beard (NOT (pseudo)follicitis barbae). For years I took intermittent and then suppressive doxycycline with some suppression of the follicitis, but never a remission. Retrospectively the time correlation between NoPoo and development of the folliculitis seems pretty clear, but at the time I couldn't attribute a clear cause. I do have a history of acne (requiring accutane) and changing my pillow cases daily seemed a bit helpful but was unsustainable. Ultimately I tried daily shampooing with strong salisylic acid shampoo and have been folliculitis free for months for the first time in YEARS. 

Let this be a cautionary tale that if you are prone to development of comedones (acne) and are likely colonized with MRSA via healthcare work or high-level physical activity/gym going, then NoPoo may result in chronic skin issues.

I tried the distilled water and acv today and WOW my scalp feels great, my hair isn’t greasy, and it has volume! Worlds a difference from the greaseball lumpy tangly mess I had when I tried shampoo bars before.

I did more research and found out that hard water leaves build up in your hair which can make your hair feel disgusting. It also doesn’t rinse out. It basically adds chlorine and a load of other crud to you hair. Plus it can cause dandruff, itchy scalp, and eczema. So I’m investing in a $30 water softener shower filter.

Look on YouTube on how to test if you have hard or soft water. This can be done with castille soap/dr bronners and a cup of your shower water. I’m sure there are other methods.

I've started using micellar water from Garnier occasionally on my face and reading a post from a few months ago I thought I'd see what happened if I used it on my hair.  I used the same amount as I normally use for my clay shampoo, about 1/3 c. and scrubbed it into my scalp.  Immediately I could tell that it was cleaning it really well, perhaps too well.  The water started to get kind of milky colored as it grabbed all the sebum.  I then rinsed it all out and used my normal conditioner so the only thing that changed in my routine was the cleanser.

Results: Not a huge fan. My hair got really tangled after using it and felt way too squeaky clean, this was almost like a sulfate wash.  I would only use this vary rarely as a clarifier.  If however you have a different style hair maybe this would work, or perhaps it could be diluted to give better results.

3719,t3_9e4i21,"Hi all,
I’ve been no poo (water only, relatively soft water) for a few months now, I love that my hair isn’t frizzy anymore but still have a range of varying issues. Some days my hair feel good after a wash but when it dries I realise it’s so full of sebum, my BBB needs a clean after one brush and I still feel left with a heap of an almost waxy feeling oil in my hair. Other times it’s smooth but oily when I wash and while it feels clean (no sweat or dirt) I don’t feel much difference in the oil sitting in my strands which then dries to just look and feel oily (rather than greasy if anyone can understand what I mean, oil thinner feel grease a thicker feel) This got bad enough that last night I busted out my old shampoo bar and ran the smallest amount of shampoo through the oiliest parts of my hair. 
I’m open to any suggestions that anyone has about the above but, my biggest problem by far is that my hair is rather fine and when I wash it and run my fingers through my hair while washing, no matter how careful or gentle I am, I have noticed a lot of recent breakage. It’s the thing that has me most tempted to go back to shampoo and conditioner (not that I want to) because using conditioner I never had so much breakage. ",NoPoo

Bit of back ground. 
Ive got long thick greek hair. It take about 3 weeks to show signs of oiliness. 
-only ever washed my hair about once a week to 1.5 week. 
-went through a no poo month or two recently using ACV and have used bi carb as a wash 3 times in that period. 
Everything was cool. Hair lovely, scalp clean.

Then the horror.
Noticing my hair getting dryer  and some dandruff i started using a tea tree shampoo and coco conditioner from 'biologika'
Seemed like it didnt work...
The dryness then started creeping to my face. Thinking maybe it was an allergic reaction so for the last 2.5 weeks ive used nothing. 
No mousteriser,
No cleansers on my face and i havent even washed my hair.  No improvment.  Argh im gross!

So i went to the dr. And he suggested to use Tgel theorputic shampoo....Buuuut it had SLS in it. I dont want to use this.. im supposed to use it 3 times a week. I fear SLS will dry my scalp more and also the damage to aquatic life that SLS does is a big no no. 

I heard moo goo scalp cream is good. I bought that yesterday.. buuut i dont know if it will work.

At the start of my dry face scalp fiasco i used some goat mousteriser and while it helped the day of applications i always woke up with it worse.

Any suggestions guys? 

Oh and previously my skin was very tollerable.  It wasnt too dry or too oily. And i never wear make up excpet maybe like once every 6 months or so.

I've not been able to try out NoPoo as consistently as I would like to. I spent much of the last 3 years with bleached blonde hair. Naturally, my hair is a mid brown, so you can imagine the state it was in. 
About 2 months ago, I decided to stop bleaching, and had my hair dresser put a brown on to cover most of the blonde. I'm planning to not dye or bleach - hopefully never again!
My hair is quite thick, and prone to breakage. My hairdresser told me that moisture is actually the worst thing for bleached hair! Bleach strips the protein out of hair, and adding moisture makes it very weak.
I discovered the power of the natural hair mask today. I mixed up an egg, coconut oil, honey, and a little cocoa powder (to help fight the fade!). I slathered it on, and left it overnight. I've washed it out with a low-poo (no Parabens or SLS). My hair is still drying - but my god it's beautiful.
I've also learned that I should not be using baking soda on my hair right now, because it's pretty good at ripping the dye out!
I hope my little experiment can be helpful to someone.

I'm looking to start my cowashing journey.  I have super fine and thin straight hair.  I've recently had some pretty bad breakage from bleaching, so I'm doing a drastic 180 and putting natural haircare at the top of my list.  I've trimmed off what I can of the breakage and am not going to bleach again.  From what I've read at /r/FancyFollicles basically my only option is to cut off the dead and wait for it to grow out. 

&amp;#x200B;

With so much information out there, I've found a ton of different techniques and conditioners to use.  Right now I'm using Suave Essentials (in a strawberry sent).  I thought that was a safe option but from my research it seems they've changed the ingredients and only the coconut ""flavor"" is the co-wash/no poo approved variety.  **Can I use the rest of this bottle? Or am I better off just going and getting a new bottle?**

&amp;#x200B;

I've read a ton about how you wash on wash day.  What no one really covers is **What does the week look like? Do you cowash everyday? Every 3-4 days?  Do you apply leave in conditioners? If so, do you do that everyday? How does that look?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Most importantly, I work out a lot-- and because of my thin/fine hair sweat basically saturates my entire head.  Due to my breakage I've been just allowing my hair to air dry after exercise (because I've sworn off any hot tools unless I'm going to a formal event or something).  **Will this method work when cowashing? How do I approach sweaty gym hair?** Do I let it dry and then try to comb through any oils? 

Finally, Do you do any additional oils in your hair, maybe at night between washes? **Show me your typical routine for cowashing!**

So last November I decided to finally make the jump and go no-poo. It was something I had been interested in trying for a couple of years but never had the courage to actually do. Here is my story (yea I know I wrote a novel) and my experience, and I hope it helps give a little hope to people just starting out who are struggling.

Starting out, my transition to no-poo was born out of circumstance more than anything. Last fall I made the decision to set up a camp out in the woods on the edge of town and make it my home. I had a rudimentary shower rig but washing up still only happened a couple times a week at most, so I used a BBB in between ""showers"" to try and tame the grease. 

After a month or so had passed and winter was getting close, I decided it was time to return to society so I got an apartment. I decided that even though I was easily able to shower every day, I wanted to keep going down the no-poo road. I researched a little more about Water-Only routines and developed one for myself. 

Every day before I showered and before I went to bed I would scritch my hair really thoroughly and go through it with my BBB. In the shower, I would scritch again while making sure the water was hitting my scalp directly where I was scritching, and move my hair around to help the water rinse out all the dirt and oil. For drying I would simply dab my hair with my towel to get some of the water out and then let it do it's thing. 

It took about 3 months for me to go through the ""transition"" phase until I no longer looked like Kurt Cobain, and now my hair is the healthiest and best-looking it has ever been. It is soo soft and shiny now, and the color even slightly changed! I have always had dirty blonde hair, but before going WO it was more light brown. Now it is waay more blonde and people have noticed. Starting out was pretty tough and I had plenty of moments where I was ready to give up, but now I wouldn't even dream of putting ANYTHING in my hair besides water. 

If you're just starting out and are stuck in the horribly waxy transition, keep going you can do it! The pay-off is definitely definitely worth it. ",NoPoo

3774,t3_97fqt0,"Hey.

I've been using castile soap for over a year, nothing else. The first 8-9 months were great (apart from transition hell). But I'm not happy with it any more as my hair feels increasingly dry. It's also always been greasy and I still have to wash it every day. For a while I could do every other day, but it's back to daily again. I'm not sure what's going on.

I have extremely thin and 'dead' hair. It looks a lot better since ditching shampoo so I won't go back. I just need to change things up.

What would be a good direction to go in? I worry co washing will make my hair look greasy and flat (I avoided conditioner previously as it made my hair that much more flat and lifeless - don't know if it would be any different now?). I'm off put by the baking powder and ACV stuff as I tried it before and it just seems cumbersome and ineffective. I don't mind making my own concoction, but only if I can make a bottle and not need too much effort every day, like cracking open an egg or whatever. If I only had to wash my hair once a week it would be another story. But I need to be able to wash it quickly without too much hassle every day.

My goal is to have healthier hair and be able to wash it less. I'll settle for healthier though. It's getting irritatingly dry!

I read years ago that the straighter and longer your hair is, the harder it is to ditch shampoo. So I'm happy I've managed to at all. But I would *love* to not have it get greasy every day and to wash it less often. I can try another 'transition' period, I just don't trust I'll get results. I'm not sure what to try.

Any suggestions or advice? 

Thank you.

3822,t3_92mtbi,So I've suffered from average as well as cystic acne for most of my life. The past couple years it has been clearing up a lot but I still suffer one or two cystic pimples a month and then some whiteheads throughout. Recently I have noticed my skin complexion in general becoming a lot worse my pores look huge and I've come into the worst breakout I've had maybe since high school. There are several different factors that could be causing the acne but I'm afraid that one of them is the fact that I've recently attempted the No Poo/Low Poo method again. so I guess I just wanted to know if there's any advice out there on the transition period of no poo and face acne. last time I tried no poo I did get acne on my scalp but this time since I am still using a low poo once or twice a week I haven't been suffering from that but my hair is still greasy/waxy most of the time so I'm afraid that it's transferring to my face and causing the acne. Is there any way to avoid this? My hair is already up most of the time but that doesn't seem to be making a difference. I don't want to shampoo more often just to avoid the acne if I did that I might as well go back to regular Poo but I really don't know if I can suffer through this my entire transition. Especially considering I'm still messing around with what works for my hair.,NoPoo

I didn’t even let they know what I’m doing because I know they will say that’s disgusting and won’t accept it because they are so close minded.

I'm having some doubts about this No poo.. well. no.. having doubts about No conditior and need some help.  


I've tried looking at the FAQ and pinned post stuff but on my desk top i can't see the community info.. it's only on my phone and it's really hard to see and go to all the links.  
my hair history.  
 i live in Australia, I have type 2ish hair. but it's super thick. super greek and below shoulder legnth.  
For my life I have only needed to wash my hair once a week or once a fortnight sometimes.  
my hair never gets oily, the only reason i'd actually wash is that after about a week it would get itchy and gunky.  
I am ( was) an avid user of products, due to my hair not being naturally oily i would use a lot of leave in conditioners and oils. it would jsut soak it up, but my hair wasn't ever really dry either except the ends... my hair is in "" good"" condition apart from having all these chemicals in it.  


 recently, I mistakenly have done two washes ( 1 each week) with bi carb prior to doing a last sulphate wash to get rid of the silicones. and used AVC.  the first week was amazing. my scalp never felt so clean, but by the second week my hair was getting very knotty and kinda... elastic? when i'd brush it would spring/stretch/pull and then break. it didn't feel.. like.. good.  
wash ratios i used  was 1 and half TBS bi carb and 2 Cup water.  
ACV 20ml to 320ml water  
last night i did a massive coconut oil left it in untill tonight where i have done my last sulphate wash.  
I rinsed with AVC ( i hope that is okay)  


I am mostly confused about the no conditioner part. I understand that ACV is supposed to replace that part?  
Also what is a replacement for a leave in conditioner? a lot of suggestions are oils.. but that makes my hair look oily?as each time i used oils for the past 2 weeks it made my hair more oily than it used to.   
the oils i used was coconut and teatree ( teatree on account of dandruft)  


am I to just trust that i wont need any conditioner or treatment after a shower eventually?also sometimes i straighten my hair, but i suppose i will have to give up a heat protectant? is there an alternative? will i need to do that anymore considering my hair ""should"" be getting healthier and stronger?  


okay, thats it i think. sorry guys.. and thank you.

[the comb in question ](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/schwarz-manufacturing-co-brass-comb) is made of brass, which is a big part of what makes it so cool but I was just wondering the other day if it has the potential to damage my hair more than a plastic or wooden comb.  My hair is really thick and it always has at least a knot or two which I have to use a bit of force to get through, and I'm a little bit worried the sharper metal teeth could do some harm if I force it through my hair.

Anyhow, over the weekend I had some time off, so I though I'd do a full hair treatment. Started off with one week greasy hair (this would be the time I usually wash it).

I first did a milk and honey mask. Melted three teaspoons of honey into a cup or two of full fat milk, soaked my towel dried hair with the mixture focusing on the ends. Let it sit for close on an hour, then rinsed it out with water only.

Had some castor oil laying around, and put some on the most damaged sections of my hair while still damp. Let it sit for a day.

Did a egg yolk mask/wash (as I will do anytime I really need to clean the hair like now due to the oil), and put a small amount of a Lush massage bar (mainly cocoa and shea butter) on the ends as a conditioner.

My hair is the softest and nicest it has been in such a long time! The shine is crazy, and not oily or waxy at all. I think my hair was just dying for some moisture.

Try this if your hair feels a bit dry and unmanageable. I will def incorporate milk and honey masks more frequently.

Sorry for the poor picture qualities :/

Hair description:

My hair is brown/reddish, thin, mid-long, and I usually dye it once a month with supermarket dye shampoos to cover some whites. 


Perspective:

I believe this is the ideal moment for me to transition, since I'm going on holiday (no stress about greasy hair in the office) and I'll spend my third transition week at the seaside (potentially a lot of sea water + normal water washes).


Questions:

1. About NoPoo products:

I don't want to use anything but water (and comb/brush). No rye flour, no baking soda, etc. Is this realistic? 


2. About washing or not washing:

I've already started by not washing my hair for 4 days (I usually wash it every other day or max every 3 days). Today it's greasy. Should I wash it with water already or waiting is better? 


3. About hair dye:

Towards the end of week #3 I will have to dye my hair again before I go to the office. Can I still use the supermarket dye? (no henna, it can give you skin cancer and I already have it 😄, thank you) ",NoPoo

My hair always looked greasy at the top and dried out in the lengths. It didn't bother me that much because I usually put it up in a braid. But I also lose much more hair than before.

My hair just feels OK! Nothing especially wrong with it, but it doesn't feel extra special either. I would say it seems a little dry. It doesn't feel soft, but my hair grows thick and is considered curly I think. I see no reason to stop, and it's nice not having to worry about shampoo. Right now I'm just growing my hair out longer.

Sorry if this has been posted a million times but I just found this topic in one of my Facebook groups and looked up this subreddit right away. 

To give a bit of background, for the last year or so my scalp has been super oily. If I don’t wash my hair every other day (might have to switch to everyday soon!) it looks really gross. 

Did anyone have this issue and did nopooing help? What are the transition phases like as your hair adjusts? I’m starting a new job soon in a position that’s very people facing so I’m a bit worried about getting scolded for my hair (which my old job did!). 

Also, I see people mention using a boar thistle hair brush. Is there any particular one that you guys would recommend?

I wanted to document my no shampoo journey here. I have a mid-length bob, blond hair, kind of wavy and want to let it grow and to have curls 🙈 (my dream 😍). I did the transitioning from conventional shampoo to organic, without sulfate / silicone a few years back but never really attempted a real no shampoo apart from one time in holidays at the sea. 

My hair gets kind of greasy but at the same time it’s dry if I don’t wash it. some other times it’s limp and greasy, depending on hormons I guess. I washed it every 2 or 3 days with shampoo and I have really hard water. It best form is on the sea side were it gets crazy curly and I can stretch out the washing. It doesn’t get too much oily, but lot of volume and a bit dry (because of the sea salt that I just wash out with water).

Now my last wash with shampoo was 3 days ago. Today I washed my hair with one organic egg (yellow + white), I put some essential oils in it and rinced out with lots of water. I finished with AVC. My hair is really soft, bouncy and feels clean. No greasiness ! 

I hope you can see the photos ! Any question welcome and sorry for my english 😉.

Ever since I was a teenager whenever I washed my hair, From then on to the second day with just water, it would ALWAYS be waxy as hell.

I even tried no shampoo for a few months with only water and the wax built al the way down to my hair tips and would not go away, apple cider vinegar never did anything.

I have been on it for 40 days. There was dandruff and all in the beginning but everything was fine. 

One problem I had was that my hair gets all tangled up like messy and all if I don't use oil. I usually use coconut hair oil.  Like I can't comb my hair unless I use oil. I wanted to know if this is something I should be concerned about.

3901,t3_8t3w5g,"Hi all, I'm 21 year old male hair with medium length, wavy/curly brown hair (not quite at my shoulders).

I tried NoPoo a month ago as I got tired of the following routine: Day 1 - I shampoo and my hair looks frizzy and brittle, Day 2 - it looks nice but slightly greasy Day 3 - looks greasy and need to shampoo 

So I quit shampoo and have been water only since I wanted something completely low maintenance. However, I am now finding that using shampoo was less maintenance than this. My hair constantly feels stuck on my head, it looks bad unless I use dry shampoo. I have to brush it to bring down the oils (never used to brush my hair) but it feels like the oils stay up there. 

I'm close to giving in the towel, as I don't like this feeling. I know there is an awkward stage to get past, but brushing my hair and constantly massaging my hair  is more effort than using shampoo!

Is there something that I could use that is good for wavy hair to keep it ungreasy? I don't really care about the shampoo toxicity stuff, and I'm willing to use it maybe once a week if I have to. Any advice on how to get into a routine for this?",NoPoo
3902,t3_8sy37t,"So as I'm now almost 2 months in NoPoo, I've done my share of experimenting with NoPoo options. Egg yolk wash works the best, but I can't do it every time because of protein build up. After doing some homework, I found that it's the emulsifier aspect of the yolk that washes hair so well : it binds to the excess hair oils and washes right out. So going further down the rabbit hole, I read that soy lecithin is an emulsifier with very little protein. PERFECT. Or so I thought. I started washing my hair with it, scrubbing the granules to my scalp and my hair was nooooot feeling it. In fact, the more I scrubbed, the more it started to dreadlock. For reference, I have medium thickness, straight, shoulder length hair. IT HAS NO BUSINESS DREADLOCKING. It's like the strands started clupming together and they're also sticky??? The best way I could describe it is like if you downed an entire bottle of hair spray in your hair and dumped your head under a faucet for a second - that clumpy, sticky hair feeling. Guys, I don't know how to wash it out. I tried undiluted castille soap and even an anti-residue shampoo I had leftover from my shampoo days. Hardly anything. I cracked two eggs and washed with the egg yolk as well.. all of those things maaaaaybe made it like, 1/5 better. Rubbing alcohol didn't work, and neither did reguar hair oil.

3904,t3_8svwuj,"Hello reddit. I've so far loved my NoPoo experience. I embarked on my 6 month long journey last November, and have kept a simple routine for about 4 months without any interruptions or mishaps. 
I am a dude, and lately I've been sporting a mild, faded undercut with an ever-growing 5 inch top. I don't use any store-bought hair gels, pomades, products etc. A few months back I used to put a little coconut oil in my hair though it left very grotesque and offensive smell within a day or so of applying it. It gave my hair a little more hold though it did not drastically improve anything, so I decided to go with out it. Overall, going NoPoo has given my hair some more hold, meaning that it has been easier to style it and push it up and away from my face without any products. The natural oils and sebum really serve as their own kind of gel or product. However, despite this natural improvement, I'm left wanting something a little better.

I recently went to barbershop for a trim and decided to allow my barber to put a little bit of product in my hair. I must admit, that despite NoPoo making my hair look more natural and healthy, certain products give me a look that I cannot achieve naturally. The barber put some sort of ""tonic"" and fiber gel into my hair, and I really like the way it holds. I don't apply any synthetic products on a daily basis, and I don't think that I ever will, though to see that my hair can look so cool when styled-up with manly (think '60s rockstar) products is certainly refreshing. 
After this ordeal, I decided to wash my hair with a sulfate-containing shampoo for the first time in 4 months (note: I had been strictly water-only during that 4 month period as well), in order to get rid of any build up I had accumulated from the products the barber put in my hair, over time etc. I must admit that it left my hair feeling extremely clean, despite it stripping my hair of its natural oils. However, washing with this shampoo left my hair lifeless and lacking in volume (fell flat on my forehead). The gentlest of winds blew my quiff into a stupid-looking fringe. I decided that I needed to find a natural product that would help me keep my hair off of my face whilst enriching it naturally. I remembered reading about flaxseed hair gels a while back, though I only found it mentioned in strictly curly hair forums, African/frizzy hair oriented forums etc. I wondered if it would work on relatively straight hair, if it could act as a natural styling agent such as more traditional, synthetic hair products for men (flaxseed gel is directed at curly-haired women). I went to the store and bought a bag of flaxseeds, followed a simple recipe I found online, and made my own batch of the gel. I applied it to my hair while damp, and blowdried it for a few minutes. While I found that the hold wasn't as strong as I had hoped, it really does its job well at keeping my hair off of my face. I would consider a light-hold product. Longevity and the nutritional value of this product can be enhanced by adding honey or any of the well known natural oils often discussed on this sub.

*It should be noted that I used this product after washing my hair with sulfate shampoo, thus ridding my hair of it's natural oils. I hope that once my hair returns to equilibrium, which I suspect will happen in about 4-5 days, that the flaxseed gel will work together with my hair's natural oils in order to produce a stronger hold. Thank you for reading and I apologize for the wall of text. 

Verdict: In my experience, flaxseed gel, which is often directed at frizzy or curly haired women, works on shorter and straighter hair, acting as a light-hold product sufficient to keep hair off of one's forehead and or face

* Improved mood, energy, and alertness.
* Muscle weakness gone and improved grip.
* Stopped feeling cold all the time.
* No longer sore/stiff after physical labor, such as mowing lawn.
* No more mucus when spitting.
* Less brittle, more manageable hair.

I had made no other changes.  After about a week, the gains seemed less dramatic, but still there.  Perhaps there was a detox period and things had leveled off, I thought.

&lt;b&gt;Xanthan Gum Hair Gel - Lasts about 2 weeks in the fridge&lt;/b&gt;

You need a double-boiler setup for this one.  (A metal or glass bowl that is big enough to set in a pot without touching the bottom of the pot but still sitting in water in the pot.)

Ingredients:
-1/2 cup + 2Tbsp distilled water
-1/2 cup aloe juice
-1/2 tsp Xanthan Gum
-1/2 tsp Guar Gum
-1/2 tsp agave nectar or honey (double for more hold - except in high-humidity.  It won’t work well on humid days/ in humid climates.)
-6 drops grape seed oil - use a bit more if using more nectar/honey

Directions:
1. Mix water, aloe, and gums in bowl from double-boiler. 
2. Place on pot of water and turn on heat.  Whisk.  Once water in pot is boiling, turn it down and continue whisking until the mixture thickens and the granules disappear.
3. Remove from heat and add agave or nectar, whisk and let cool to warm instead of hot.
4.  Add oil, mix well, then let cool to room temperature.
5.  Transfer to an air-tight container and refrigerate.  

Freeze half for longer preservation.

&lt;b&gt;Hair Spray - Indefinite shelf-life&lt;/b&gt;

Ingredients:
-1 1/2 cup distilled water
-2 Tbsp white sugar
-1 Tbsp vodka or other high-proof vodka (apparently spiced rum gives this a very nice smell) - preservative

Directions:
1. Boil water.  Add sugar and stir to dissolve.
2. Cool to room temperature, transfer to a spray bottle and add alcohol.  Shake to combine.
3. Store at room temperature.

&lt;b&gt;Hairspray - Alcohol-free&lt;/b&gt;

Ingredients:
-1 cup distilled water
-4 tsp white sugar

Directions:
1. Boil water.  Add sugar and stir to dissolve.
2. Cool to room temperature, transfer to a spray bottle. Store at room temperature.

Note: this one didn’t have any mention of shelf-life. I suspect it’s why you make less at a time. If you use this, smell it occasionally. It may go off over a week or three.

Mix 1-2 Tbsp Low poo conditioner to 1 cup water in a spray bottle. Shake well.  Spray on wet hair and comb through starting at he ends and making your way up slowly after each comb-through.

Adjust your ratios if you need to. If you have very fine hair, use a lot less conditioner. It will weigh your hair down and make it look greasy if you use too much. Also, different conditioners will give you different results. Shea Moisture Weightless conditioner will be much lighter than a coconut oil or castor oil based conditioner. ",NoPoo

Waxiness and dandruff were inmediatly gone. Instead, i got super clean hair when i got out of the shower, but didnt feel heavy or dry as it used to feel when i used shampoo. Still losing lots of hair tho! :c But now i'm sure that's because of my diet.

Its been a week since i did the egg yolk wash, and no rinses in between. My hair right now starts to feel greasy, but really slightly. Compared to how it got super greasy two days after washing it with shampoo, so its a huge difference!.

3954,t3_8lb4ac,"So I let one of my kombucha cultures grow without tending to it and it gave me a hefty-ass 1 inch thick kombucha SCOBY. Has anyone ever tried blending a kombucha SCOBY and making it a thick smoothie type paste to rub in their hair? I've heard of using the kombucha vinegar as a rinse (obvs being acidic, as a substitute for apple cider vinegar or lemon juice), so my logic is why not the SCOBY itself, right? Maybe even add some essential oils to it / blended herbs and stick it in a glass jar in the fridge and take out as much as needed for a shampooing. 
My only reservation is that it's the bacterial / fungal culture itself instead of the vinegar, so I'm wondering if it will mess up hair's bacterial balance.
Am I going too far down the rabbit hole with this? 

Anyways, will experiment and update. If my hair falls out, well.. now we know. 

OK, UPDATE!:
So I cut off a 2x2 piece of SCOBY and blended it with some filtered water. Thanks to Je4Fy, I had the good sense to cut quarter sized pieces with some scissors instead of putting the whole chunk in there and burning my blender motor. I have a good enough blender that it blended into a thicker applesauce-type texture, which is what I wanted. I added a couple drops of Cedarwood and Rosemary essential oils for flavor, but that's not anything new added to my hair. 

The wash went fairly well. I had about 1/3 of a cup of SCOBY which I scrubbed into my hair and left for about 10 min. I rinsed for 2-3 min. 

Upon checking my hair in the mirror, I saw little flakes that you would see when doing a rye flour wash. By this point my hair was half dry and I didn't want to wet it again, so I figured I'd let it dry and then snow-flurry the flakes out (gross, I know, but whatevs). 

Well, it wasn't as easy to snow-flurry as the SCOBY doesn't get dry like rye flour, it's naturally rubbery so it was a pain to get out. It's the next day and I'm still finding small flakes but I'd say it's 95% out. And I have straight, short hair that's not even that thick! I would nooot recommend it for curly or long hair. My naturally soft oily hair also felt dryer and coarser as it was drying, but normalized once dry. 

In closing, I'm not sure I would do it again. The only positive that I can MAYBE see is that I swear my hair grew a little overnight. But then again, I'm using EO and Biotin to stimulate hair growth, sooo.. the jury's still out on that one. But it also seems coincidental. hmmph. 
Also, my scalp feels slightly tingly/itchy here and there (like if you didn't rinse out your apple cider vinegar well enough), but I don't know if that's just my paranoia that I washed my hair with a living bacterial and fungal paste. 

TL;DR: Yeah.. I honestly don't think I'd try it again. The SCOBY is just too much of a pain to wash out and I didn't care for the coarser texture while it was drying. Anyways, it was worth the experiment!",NoPoo

3986,t3_8f1tfk,"I've been doing no poo for probably close to 8 months now and like it. I originally was doing water only and thought it worked good. It grossed my wife out, she thought my hair was oily (I didn't think so but whatever), and moved to baking soda shampoo/apple cider vinegar once a week. After a bit of trial and error I got a good ratio and love how it makes my hair feel really silky soft and clean. I wouldn't say it feels dirty or oily by the end of the week, but I do notice a difference after I use the BS/ACV. I do use a boar bristle brush throughout the week but don't find it's as necessary as it was under the water only method. Also, I'm actively growing out my hair, it's about ear to jaw length.

I was wondering how often I should use it? I had read not to use it daily, but I do work out three days a week, so my hair gets pretty sweaty and I still just do a good water only wash during the week. Would it be bad to use it daily or every other day? What about using a ""normal"" shampoo/conditioner daily? I found one on amazon with good reviews, that says ""NO HARSH CHEMICALS: No triclosan, sulfates, quats, formaldehyde, salicylates, parabens, phosphates, SLS, SLES, MEA, DEA, TEA, petroleum-based ingredients, animal by-products, perfumes, dyes or caustics"".

First of all, sorry if my english seems weird : I'm french, trying my best :p
So I recently started the Nopoo thing 2 weeks ago. I never had that period where my hair went super greasy though but I spent a lot of time in my shower malaxing my scalp under hot water. I feel my scalp is getting better, I had some psoriasis in the back of my head and was very itchy. I don't have that anymore at least, less than before.
But I have some issues now, my face and my body went itchy like 3 or 4 days ago, i dunno why but this is real bad, i get read just for scrathing it. I was wondering if I'm attracting some weirds insects and never had that the first days of Nopoo.
I'm under treatment for acnee and using some ""Hyfac"" products (cleansing gel, global care for the day and ""Epiduogel"" for the night) but never had that issues when I started the treatment a month ago.
Also, I red it wasn't too good to stay too much under hot water for dandruff issues, I had some before Nopoo but not that much now. Should I try mid temperatured water ?
And I can't decide myself if still go full Nopoo or do I buy some conditioner and shampoo adapted for me, I have to go to the haircut and fear that so much to ruin all my efforts...

I just cleaned my BBB for the first time (had it for about a month, been using it on day 2 and 3 after washing) and there was a lot of white filminess on the bristles, and the hairs that I pulled out felt filmy and gross as well. Is it normal for the brush to collect grossness, or can I expect it to lessen over time? Or is it a sign that I should change my routine, even though I thought it was working well for my hair?

It's weird because my scalp hasn't been flaky, and my hair does start to feel dirty by day 3 after washing, but it is never as gross as this brush felt before cleaning it.

(My routine: The last time I used shampoo was 2/28/18 and since then I've been washing with diluted Dr. Bronner's followed by a diluted ACV rinse and cool water. 2 days between washes for the month of March, and since 4/1 I've been going for 3 days between washes.

4002,t3_8c4nzr,"My best friend has been trying to get me to go no-poo for years now. It has never worked for me. Until now.

About my hair: Naturally dirty blonde, about 20-30% gray, frequently highlighted (as in every 6 weeks-two months; very fine hair, but not necessarily thin, has a lot of volume when blown dry straight; waves/ curls a bit (2b-c depending on length) yet without any rhyme or reason.  Hair currently is about an inch or two below my chin (i.e., not quite long enough to put into a neat sleek pony tail). I haven't worn my hair this long in ages because it typically breaks off before it gets past my shoulders, and just looks ratty. And when it's that long and I put it in a hairband, it's just so fine, well, we call it ""the nubbin."" And I have to tie the hairband so tight since it'll just slip off, it results in breakage. My hair prefers the dreaded clippy, but this is 2018. :-(

My ends typically always look dry and destroyed. But oils just don't work either. Over the years I've tried it all - jojoba, morrocan, coconut oil, olive oil.. before, during after shower, and overnight with a cap on. It just sits on my hair making it look like a super shiny grease pit, and doesn't seem to absorb. Though does soften my hair -- once I shampoo it out.

Also - a big ALSO - I have had scalp psoriasis since I was a child. It can get really bad, as in covering my entire scalp. This isn't dandruff either. Big flakes, lots of itch. Prescription shampoo (Clobetasal) works great to control it, but if I've run out then I am abusing my hair with all kinds of harsh tar shampoos. 

I am really careful to avoid chlorine or salt water or too much sun, as all of that can result in straw hair for me. Yet my hair plumps up and/or frizzes in high humidity. Which sometimes can make it look great, I just can't predict. 

Best friend aforementioned has gorgeous thick straight long hair, which she washes only once a week, and looks perfect regardless of the weather. She insists it's as fine and thick as mine, but I just don't see it.

So I have tried this no-poo thing numerous times over the years, yearning for same healthy head of hair, with zero success. Even if I could endure the grease of day 2 / 3 hair, I couldn't endure the psoriasis flare up which was unbearable. 

Then I got a new hairdresser who recommended a new shampoo and conditioner, which is sulfate, paraben, and silicone free. I have been using it daily for 6 months.  Alternating with the prescription shampoo every now and then... and then less and less. Because my scalp has totally cleared up! It's never felt better!!!!

Two weeks ago I decided to give no-poo one last try. My girlfriend is visiting me at the end of this month so I figured I could maybe try until then. 

Week one I was able to go 6 days without washing!!!!! I am amazed. I've never been able to go that long. (Note I did one last wash with the Rx shampoo, no conditioner. Then I did a WO wash a few times the first week, and co-washed when needed for de-tangling. Then on the last day tried curly girl method -- using olive oil-- and it was a disaster so I shampooed). 

This week, I am on day 6 again and I think I can push it at least one more day, as I invested in a BBB brush which does seem to be helping. I still seemed to need to WO wash it twice this week, and I put on just a little (like a teaspoon) worth of conditioner on the ends to de-tangle in the shower with a wide-tooth comb. 

I'd love to let my natural waves go free, but I'm finding that my hair seems to want to be blown dry straight. I am thinking that the heat of the blow dryer helps the sebum penetrate the shaft or something? It definitely looks and feels the best when I blow dry it straight after a WO wash.

I'll add here that in the past I did try dry shampoos, but they left me unbearably itchy on the scalp, so much so, I had to hop in the shower. I'll also add that I am very hesitant to try BS or ACV, as I am reading mix reviews about their effects.

I've been trying out the no poo method for well over a month now, and I'm still having problems. My hair is straight and very fine, at collarbone length, half grown out natural and half damaged from bleach thanks to a mishap a couple years ago with a stylist. The worst of it has been cut off long ago but compared to my natural virgin hair it's an entirely different type of hair altogether. 

I don't shower often because of my eczema anyway, so I have already been keeping my hair washing to a minimum before I started going no poo, but I still can't find a balance. Every time I go through all the effort of BBB, masks, baking soda, vinegar, etc, my hair will ALWAYS come out after a shower being overly oily on my roots and dry as heck on the damaged parts and the ends. It's driving me up the wall. I already have naturally blonde hair so too much oil always stands out no matter what I do. As a result I end up having to put cornstarch into my freshly washed hair and I am starting to feel skeptical about people who talk about healthy shiny hair when mine has to end up being a matte mess all the time. 

I try honey, and my hair gets dry. I try oils, and I can't get them out unless I use egg which often I don't have the time for at that point. It's a nightmare. 
Currently I've had a honey and kefir mask on overnight, showered normally today and my ends are so dry they are crunchy, but still somehow oily roots despite doing baking soda and vinegar in the shower. 

For extra info: I have hard water, but I did get a shower filter. It's not a full water softener but its the best I can do. I also can't find any ACV where I am (Poland), so I've been using diluted white vinegar. I also dilute my baking soda quite a bit (about 1/5 to water). 

What am I missing here? Should I revert to using shampoo and conditioner until my damaged hair grows out completely?

4035,t3_85prnu,"**Background**

&amp;nbsp;

Ever since I've taken finding the right look and haircut for myself seriously, I've realized that every time I used shampoo, my hair would puff up and become frizzy after drying. I'm currently growing out my hair to go for a ""short on sides, long on top"" kind of haircut for my curly hair.

Something like this: https://i.imgur.com/bRQ1jNp.jpg

Right now I'm combing my hair flat to the side to avoid looking like an overgrown bush while I await my next haircut appointment.
I have thick, black, wavy hair (the degree of which is undetermined as I have not yet grown it long enough) with low porosity.

&amp;nbsp;

**Approach**

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I grabbed the bull by the horn and started off doing water only once a week on Fridays and am pleasantly surprised with the results. I have been sporadically following the scritching, preening, boar-bristle brushing (SPB) routine every 1-4 days, depending on how my scalp and hair feel from justprimalthings.com albeit not having a boar bristle brush, which I substituted by gripping bundles of hair with my fingers and running through their length in different patterns.

&amp;nbsp;

**Week 1**

* Hair feels much oilier, though not as bad as I've read through other posts. Hands feel quite oily after running hands through hair.
* Hair feels really solid, crusty, and clumpy after taking a shower, taking on a straw-like consistency and texture.
* Hair dried really quick and I had itchy / dry scalp later in the day, and next few days.

&amp;nbsp;

**Observations:**

I believe I my hair had a straw-like texture because I had just begun this schedule after using shampoo, I also used hot water when showering because I thought I would be A-OK as long as I did not use shampoo, however week 2 proved that wrong. I finished my shower with cold water (knob turned all the way). This is also the week when I used a lot of coconut oil on my ends to reverse the damage from using my old hair products.

&amp;nbsp;

**Week 2**

* Hair feels less oily, I feel like my oils have distributed themselves more evenly throughout my hair
* Hair feels softer, heavier, silkier, w/ more structural integrity and less frizz. This is more true in the front of my head rather than the back, which still somewhat has a straw-like texture. Perhaps I need to moisturize that area?
* No longer feels like straw and retains moisture for a really long time after combing and flattening it, and it stayed moist after drying.

&amp;nbsp;

**Observations:**

This time when showering, I used warm water instead of hot water. I think this helped to retain the natural oils from my hair and allow them to keep their ability to stay moisturized even after drying, since hot water strips too much oils and dries out my hair.

Another thing I've noticed is that when I use cold water to wash, it feels like there is a lot of friction going on between my fingers and my hair, however when I use warmer water the hair feels much softer when washing and less friction goes on. I definitely would have considered washing with cold water if it didn't feel like I was pulling my hair all the time. Can someone explain this? Rinsed with cold water to cool down hair and close up hairs sheaths and pores.

&amp;nbsp;

**Pictures**

Before: https://imgur.com/a/Kv4um

After: https://imgur.com/a/Bk7sv

&amp;nbsp;

The pictures were taken at night, and my hair is completely dry in all of the photos. Its appearance today has deviated very little from the shape that I combed it into after my morning shower, and what astonishes me is the difference in how easily I can style my hair, how moisturized it feels, the difference in frizz, and how it keeps its shape. If you look at the last image with the top view of my head, you'll notice that the pattern of the hair at the front looks different than the pattern from the back. Compared to the front, the back is clumpier, frizzier, and drier, reminiscent of the old appearance of my hair - though not as much as when I first started.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion / TL;DR**

&amp;nbsp;

All in all, my hair has reduced in frizziness, has become much easier to sculpt, retains moisture better, feels softer, dries quicker, and is less oily on non-wash days. This is evident in the change of appearance of my frontal hair, although not as pronounced in the back parts of my scalp for some reason. Perhaps it needs time to catch up.

I used to wash my hair with a shampoo bar bur decided to try BS / ACV, which did not work for me it made my head so itchy. Then I tried washing with an egg and that worked really well but i have long hair and it was more expensive in eggs than shampoo! So i went back to the same shampoo bar but this time i have the waxies really badly and i can't figure out why. Does anyone know why this has happened or do you have a good remedy for it. Thanks.

4037,t3_85g2px,"Ever since I was a teenager I had incredibly greasy hair. If I showered that morning the grease would be clearly visible by the end of the day. My mom was like that too so I figured it was just genetics. 

Still, a couple years ago I was determined to stop using shampoo and I tried really hard at it for a few months since I didn't have to go outside for work. I read this sub a lot and tried all the suggestions. By the end of those months my hair was able to go a couple days without being covered in grease but the third day there was no way it looked presentable. I figured I was just doomed to super greasy hair all the time if I wanted to stay away from shampoo so I quit.

A few days ago I decided to try again. I'm on the 5th day of just washing with water and my hair is not greasy at all!! I'm going to have no trouble keeping it up this time and I'm so happy. 

The only reason I can imagine such a change is because a few weeks ago I started trying to be super healthy which included going vegan and cutting out all processed food. I haven't been pregnant or anything else I can think of that would have had an impact on my hormones. Literally the only changes I've made between now and two years ago is my diet. 

I didn't even eat a lot of meat in the first place either. I did eat a lot of processed food though. I could have guessed that quitting meat would result in somewhat less grease being produced but the difference is astounding to me. And it's only been a few days so I expect it to just get better as time goes on. I'd say probably half the hair is pulled out when I brush after showering and my head has stopped being itchy (I decided to quit shampoo again cause I was starting to get hives, yikes).

I just wanted to share that with you guys. Especially if you're already considering a lifestyle change, this is just one more reason to do it. I'm already feeling physically better than I have in my life too. It was a hard change to make but so worth it, and now I'm just waiting till my hair starts looking fuller and nicer too :D",NoPoo

I feel like I've been doing EVERYTHING right but the last week and a half I've got a terrible waxy build-up and dandruff. This is gonna be a long one, I'm sorry...

I've been doing WO for a month, but have been no-poo for about a year and a half using shampoo bars and ACV. My hair is long and wavy/curly, not quite thin, but definitely not thick. So here's my routine:
The first couple of weeks of WO my hair got greasy obviously, but I was **scritching, preening and using my BBB** with good effect. I've been scritching and preening when washing as well, first with **hot water, then cold**. My hair's been a little greasy, but I've been able to wear it down for a day or so without looking too gross. I squeeze most water out of my hair and then put it up in a **t-shirt** for a couple of minutes only, and apply **jojoba oil** to the ends. I detangle with a wide toothed comb. I use my BBB every other night before bed, and I sleep on a **silk pillowcase** that I rinse every other day if I'm too lazy to do a proper wash. I sometimes BBB in the morning if my hair is very greasy. I've been **washing every two or three days**. I know for sure I have **soft water** so that shouldn't be a problem. The last week I also tried washing with **only cold water**, but it just didn't dissolve anything properly and hair looked the same as when I got in the shower.

I had little specks of dandruff in varying amounts when I was nopoo, but nothing like this. This feels as if I've used a no poo bar with no ACV rinse in hard water for the first time ever... It's difficult to preen even because it's so waxy. My brush is also covered in white dust after having thoroughly cleaned it and used it just one time. What the fork is up with my hairs!? I really really want so bad to be WO and it's so frustrating when I feel like I've been doing everything right, I was on the right track and now I'm just confused and have bad hair..

**TLDR; Please read the bolds anyway I'm sorry this is so long!!!**

But with the oncoming hot weather I sweat and notice my hair getting oilier and less voluminous. Should i do something else to solve the oily issue now that it's going to get hotter where I live? 
The only thing I've done thus far is water wash every other day and scrub scalp and my hair has been fine. ",NoPoo
4063,t3_813leg,"I've been doing No-Poo for about two months, and I want to share some things I've noticed/potential benefits, for all the struggling people out there.

A bit of background first: my hair is about shoulder-length, mostly straight, not very dense, extremely low-porosity, and has leftover highlights. I've had various scalp issues, and my hair has always gotten really oily really fast, and so I've tried various methods, but I never washed it more than once every 5 days because it was too much of a hassle. Before really starting no-poo I had been unknowingly using a silicone-free shampoo, and I had also been dilluting it, so my transition period was definitely not as bad as it could've been.
So here are some changes I've noticed:

**Hair never feels gross** - No matter what conventional shampoo I used, my hair would always get really greasy at the crown on day 3, and it would kind of clump together, so much so that I could barely run my hands through it. Now, while it never feels as 'clean' as it used to with conventional shampoo, even after 7 days of not washing it doesn't feel half as gross as it used to after 3 days. I could go a lot longer and it would be fine, but I choose not to because for once in my life I actually enjoy washing it.

**Never feels dried out** - With conventional shampoo, it always felt like I had two different hair textures: the crown always oily and clumped together, but the roots always dry and brittle. Whereas now its texture in general feels different, more uniform, with the highlights only a tiny bit drier than the rest, but not enough to be a problem. Also I never get tangles anymore.

**More volume** - Conventional shampoo always made it frizzy, unnaturally puffy, and really hard to manage. Now it has more volume, it never looks limp, no matter what I use on it, and the individual strands feel a lot stronger.

**Grows faster** - I never really wanted to grow it out, but there was always a point when it kind of just... stopped growing, even if I trimmed it regularly. But now it grows incredibly fast, probably because of all the brushing and massaging I've been doing. 

**Less scalp problems** - I'm pretty sure I have seb-derm, but on top of that I would often get random bursts of dandruff, and I didn't know what to do about it, apart from buying anti-dandruff shampoo, which didn't do anything. There might not be much I can do against the seb-derm, but at least now the rest of my scalp never feels dry, flaky, or itchy as it used to, so I'm satisfied.

**No more hair-loss** - I had a period of time when for whatever reason I lost so much hair on a daily basis, it was really bothersome, but I didn't know the cause. Now I brush it a lot more often than I used to, but even then, and even when I wash it, I don't think I lose a third the amount that I used to.

**Dries slower** - I don't know how much of a good thing this is, but it definitely doesn't start drying as soon as I get out of the shower as it used to. I had a few weeks when it didn't feel dry even after half a day, but now it takes about 4-5 hours at most. Might be my hair freaking out, or the cold weather. I'm not too bothered.

For reference, I started No-Poo by using stuff like honey, tea, rye flour, etc. for a few weeks, and deep-conditioning often. I haven't yet found a method that works perfectly long-term, but I've been experimenting with shampoo bars, and at least I've found some natural things my hair likes (mostly acidic stuff. Fermented rice water works wonders). If I find a shampoo bar I like, I might stick with that for a while, but my long-term goal is to go water-only, if possible.

What worked for me might not work for you, but if you're struggling, I would strongly suggest not to give up, just try different things, and most of all, listen to your hair. You'll get there one day. ",NoPoo

Because of that, i decided to try the baking soda and chamomile tea method of cleansing (i didn't had any acv in hand) just to get rid of the oil. My goal was to be water only if it was possible.
I did the recommended 1 tbsp per cup. And the baking soda felt very slippery, until i rinsed it off and it felt kind of hard? Now my hair feels harder and even greasier. Yet i noticed when i brush, it left like a white residue on the bristles. And upon close inspection, my hair has tiny white dots too ): 

I do have dandruff however since i started the nopoo it seems  to have calmed a bit. I read the sidebar and thought this may be because of the water. Maybe it's just too hard for me to be water only. So i have a couple questions:

1.- should i go back to shampoo?

My hair would get stringy and unmanageable, my head would get itchy, and I’d get cystic pimples all over my scalp that would make the hair fall out

I tried different methods; boar bristle brushes, lemon washes, ACV washes, leaving it as long as I could. The best method I ever came across was mixing about a teaspoon of Tea Tree oil with 1-2 tablespoons of water, and lathering that in my hair. Helped a lil with the itchiness and made my hair a bit softer, but never completely helped. My hair would still get gross and oily and itchy a few days later.

Enter aloe vera. 
At my parents house we have heaps of massive Aloe plants, which I frequently use on my skin. 
I mixed about a tablespoon of aloe with 2 tablespoons of water, and a few drops of rosemary oil and tea tree oil. 
How much aloe you use should depend on your hair (I have fine, mid-back length hair, closest to hair type 2A) as you want to try and completely cover at least your scalp
I left the aloe mix in my hair for 3 hours before rinsing it out in the shower, not following up with any shampoo or conditioner

It’s been nearly a week and my hair isn’t even slightly oily. It’s so soft and manageable; it’s never been this nice! 
Aloe vera has the same PH balance as our hair (6), so I believe it perfectly conditions it. Unlike other methods, like ACV and lemon which are slightly more acidic than our hair, the aloe balances our hair so the scalp doesn’t need to produce more oils! 

TLDR: Mix 1 tablespoon aloe with 1-2 tablespoons water, and a few drops of an oil of your choice for the nicest, most amazing hair of your life!

4085,t3_7xo0vj,"Hello. I am currently using a sulphate free shampoo and a silicone free conditioner.
After I stopped using silicones, 3 months ago I saw how my real hair looked and was so shocked that I refused to go back to sulphates/silicones to allow it to grow stronger and healthier from now on.


I have dry, brittle and very thin hair. I wash my hair every 5 days. It starts looking a bit greasy at the roots around the 3rd-4th day. But the ends are always dry.

 

Therefore!
What shampoo/conditioner would you advise me to start with? Any suggestions for a routine? All suggestions are greatly appreciated.
Thank you 

Also, sorry if this was already discussed/posted. Feel free to re direct me if that is the case. Still getting the hang of Reddit

So two things - 

1. Near the end of the week it gets super dandruff-y and itchy. I've never had dandruff so do I need to wash more often? Or will it adjust? I'm trying to was less because it feels so nice and soft towards the end of the week and I lose that when I wash it.

4089,t3_7xhk1n,"I'm a male. Trying to grow long hair. I don't really know or remember when i entered the awkward stage, but i think i am still in it, as i dont find my hair flattering. They just dont fall down the way i want them. The only thing right now that makes me feel somewhat attractive is a bun. And with my lenght its not a twist bun but a fold bun.
I noticed that when I wash my hair with shampo (and conditioner) my hair gets very puffy when it dries. Doesn't matter if I let it dry naturally or if i blowdry, when it dries it just gets super puffy which makes it unmanageable. It just settles into a middlepart which to me (at least at this lenght) looks awful and if i try to flip it to one one side it just falls back and wiggles around. If i try to make bun (probably cuz of my lenght) the front hair just escapes the rubber band, meaning i have to tie it up all over again every now and then. It doesn't have any grip. But when a day or sometimes two days go since shamooping its much easier to manage. Easier to flip it over to one side and make it stay like that, and much easier to make a bun.
I read that sulphates makes your hair puffy. So i bought sulphate free shampoo and for now i washed my hair three timss with it. Its still puffy afterwards but much less than with regular shampoo with sulphates. And a bit easier to manage on the first day.

Now I'm here asking: if i go nopoo will my hair always look and feel like the second day hair and be easier to manage? (i dont really mind if i have to water wash it every day, just so it doesnt look puffy). 

And also I saw on youtube a girl talking about nopoo and she was not satisfied. She said it made her hair gummy, and when she started using shampoo again her hair stayed gummy. I dont think i want that. So how often does it happen that someone gets gummy hair? Does it depend on hair type and skint type or did that girl do something wrong?

And also i think i have quite greasy hair. On day three or four i already have to wash it cuz i look gross and actually feels gummy like the youtuber girl said. So could that potentially be a problem?
Other than oily, grease hair, i never had much problems with my scalp (no itchiness; never had much or actually any dandruff at all, even when i had shorter hair and used styling products, although with short hair i did wash it with water only and every day, but thats short hair now i am growing it long and its already quite long).

The ends are dry but I want to see where it goes on a longer run. I saw that I'm suppose to use cold water to keep the sebum from going away and produce more and to close the pores. But, I just can't use cold water, even just for a minute. My brain won't allow it and I will probably be grumpy all day long. I know it is a caprice but you know, we all have some.

My method is basically very throughly rinsing with the hottest water I can stand about once a week. That seems to be enough. Afterwards I use a concoction my sister made called ""leg balm"". Basically my Dad has varicose veins, so my sister tried to make him something to rub into his legs. Its a mix of coconut oil, sunflower oil, beeswax, and some other stuff she wouldn't tell me. I essentially use it like hair wax, but it doesn't leave my hair feeling greasy. You have to heat it up in your hands to melt the beeswax, but after that its just like any hair wax. I don't have to do anything else to my hair after that, it maintains pretty good volume and doesn't blow around in the wind much. People still ask me how I get my hair to look so good, and its really satisfying to tell them I literally put less effort in than anyone they know.

I started doing this years ago, back when I had long hair (first year of college ftw). I would get tangles, dandruff and split ends constantly. Eventually I went travelling and had no access to showers, and after two months I came back home and everyone commented on how healthy my hair looked. I just never restarted washing it from then on. During those two months, it was a little uncomfortable to have natural oils in my hair, but I stopped noticing it after a while. The benefits quickly outweighed any negatives.

The only downside is I occasionally get an itchy scalp, but thats usually a good indicator that it needs a through rinse. I rinse more often in hot weather too.",NoPoo

I dilute the juice of half a lemon on 500 ml of water and use that to wash my hair, but i don't rinse the lemon water because if i do, the hard water makes my hair waxy again.

The problem i have is that sometimes i feel my scalp a little bit irritated, always have white flakes on my hair and when i put my fingers on my scalp, it feels dry with almost no oil.

If i use any less than half a lemon on 500 ml of water, it makes no effect and it's like washing with only water. So i wanted to ask if there is something i can do to stop the white flakes and dryness in the scalp. So far i've found on the internet that aloe vera spray may help.

And you can probably guess why I was using H&amp;S before I ditched shampoo altogether.  I was hoping that NoPoo would solve my dandruff issue but here I am a year later and while I am thrilled with the texture and life of my hair, it ironically didn't do the one thing I was hoping it would.

I was hoping I could get some input on changing up my routine to try to curb this issue.

4123,t3_blrdtf,"[Video on 5 Great Alternatives to Shampoo](https://youtu.be/Eo8wvesS1kk)

Hello Reddit!It’s FreeDaFro here to deliver the knowledge once again. Today, I will share with you 4 great alternative to Shampoo. As you already know from reading my previous videos, Shampoo is the enemy of my hair. Shampoo takes sebum oil out of your. By stripping your hair of sebum oil, shampoo can cause dry hair, breakage, and decreased hair growth.

The four methods I’m sharing with you today do not throw off your hair’s balance of sebum oil. All of these methods that I am sharing with you today are cheap and naturals. If you want stronger, darker, and thicker hair, I recommend that your use a combination of all of these methods. Each product provides its own unique benefits and the use of a variety of products will produce maximize your hair’s potential over time. These methods are list in no particular order. I find all of these products essential to my hair care regimen.

So here we go:

#1 Onion Juice:

So the first product I recommend you guys to start using is onion juice.
Onion juice is a cheap &amp; natural way to speed up you hair growth.  Onions are great for your hair and body. Onions contain a high amount of sulfur. Sulfur will speeds up your hair growth.Sulfur kills bacteria that rest on your scalp. These bacteria block clog our scalp and prevent hair follicles from emerging from our scalp. Sulfur removes this blockage allowing our hair to grow faster. Sulfur allows helps to remove dandruff from our scalp. Onion juice allows increases the blood flow to your scalp leading to increased hair growth.


Since I started using onion juice in my hair, my hair has become thicker and darker. When you first use it, your scalp will feel like its on fire. That feeling is the onion juice killing all of the bacteria in your hair. I know the idea of putting onion juice in your hair may be appalling to some people. Some of you may be concerned about a lingering onion smell being left in your hair after your hair after you use this method. I usually put  castor oil and conditioner in my hair after I use onion juice. This helps reduce the smell of onions in my hair.

If you want to make onion juice, all you simply need to is cut up and boil and onion. Let the mixture sit in your hair for 1 -2 hours. After letting it sit, rinse your hair with water. Make sure you avoid getting this product in your eyes.

If you commit to using onion juice on a consistent basis, you will see your hair get thicker and fuller.

#2 Clay Mask:

The next thing I recommend you guys try is a clay mask. 
Clay is another natural product of the earth. There are great clays out there Each has its own unique benefits. There are many recipes online but all these recipes have some of the same benefits.
Clays masks do a great job of detoxifying our hair. Tap water contains harmful metals such as lead and chlorine. Overtime, these metals build up in our hair and damage our scalp. Clay’s magnetic properties allow it to carry the metals out of our hair. Clay also kill bacteria in our scalp.

Another great thing about clay mask is that they remove oily buildup from our hair strands. Clays act like a sponge in our hair and they will soak up excess oil that lies on our hair strands. As clays coat our hair strand, it begins to fill in holes on our hair stands. This strengthens our hair and improves our curly pattern.

As I said, there are many clays for our scalp, each has its own benefits. Clay is a great alternative to shampoo because its PH level is more favorable to our scalp. Clay is a gentler way to clean your hair and it reinforces the damaged spots on your hair, unlike shampoo.  There are many clay mask recipes online. I recommend you use this product to remove build-up on your hair.


#3 Apple Cider Vinegar:

The next one I am gonna share you guys is a popular one. Apply Cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is a staple in the natural hair care community. Apple cider vinegar can remove dirty from your hair. Its best property is its ability to break apart sebum oil. When sebum oil is broken into tinier particles, it is easier to move from your scalp to your hair strands. Remember sebum is good from our hair strands because it seals help to seal in moisture. 

Since I started using apple cider vinegar my hair has become more flexible and shiny. I can comb my hair in every direction. I’ve also notice my hair has beomce more shiny too.

* Nice spray cleanse
* Adds shine
* Makes hair easier to manipulate

#4: Co-washing:

Y’all have probably heard of this one before. Co washing is a conditioner only wash. Cowashing creates a protective layer over your hair strands that help seal in moisture. Co washing is a great way to clean your hair throughout the week. If you just came back from the beach or the gym, it is a great way to quickly refresh your hair without removing any oil. 

Be careful. If done incorrectly, co washing can be harmful for our hair. The protective layer created by cowashing doesn’t allow moisture to penetrate into it. If this protective layer is always on your hair, you will not be able to get water into your hair. Overtime you will experience hair breakage. Also avoid putting conditioner on your scalp, conditioner will clog the pores on your scalp. 

You can cowash with any hair conditioner. I recommend that co wash no more that 3 times a week.",NoPoo

I have an itchy and scaly scalp and am thinning because of it (pretty sure). Been trying dandruff shampoo or anything. 

Recently bought ACV and have been doing every other day rinses instead of dandruff shampoo. Every day I do coconut oil shampoo and conditioner. 

I do the ACV rinse after shampoo. 

Hair feels the same if not worse than with dandruff shampoo. Driving me crazy. All started happening when I moved to Portland Oregon. Is it the water? The air? I’m 22 and a guy. Hairline is in the same place. Just thinner and way weaker. 

HELP

EDIT:
Thanks for all the responses so far. I use OGX coconut shampoo and conditioner (wasn’t before but doesn’t seem to make a difference). Have tried normal dandruff shampoos. Going to buy t-gel tar shampoo and try that. Sounding like a dermatologist is the only way to figure it out if that doesn’t work. I don’t want to try one of these methods for a possible misdiagnosis while it gets worse. Any thoughts?

EDIT 2: Scritching 

I watched some videos, I feel anxious massaging my scalp and pulling my hair. seems damaging.. thoughts? Can Get a brush. Im just literally pulling the hair I already am losing out over this.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I have long, straight hair that gets greasy on day two, and I just think washing it is boring. I tried no poo for about 6 months a couple of years ago, but ended up ditching it after travelling a lot and dealing with different kinds of water.   


I've read that scritching, preening and BBBing is essential to no poo, but is that absolutely necessary, or is that just if you do WO?   


I've just started up a no poo routine again, and am currently washing once a week with diluted baking soda (1 tbsp BS + 1 cup water) and using diluted white wine vinegar as a leave-in conditioner. (works amazeballs, but isn't the BS removing a lot of the natural oils? Seeing as the hair gets so squeaky clean) My plan is to move to rye flour after a couple of weeks, when the transition phase is hopefully over, because I've read that BS is damaging to your hair over time. And rye flour worked well the last time I tried it, if I remember correctly.  


Any tips for me? Also, do I really need to deep condition? If so, what's the easiest vegan way to do it?

I've been on and off water only for a bit now. I'm on and off because of my lifestyle and because I love the feeling of super squeaky clean hair. 

I have dry, damaged and thick Asian hair but after lots of botched box dyes and allergic reactions to conditioners to relieve the damage, I've lost/broken alot of it. Weaning into water only really helped the damage and growth, but every time it would get a little too oily, I'd give into shampoo. 

But recently I discovered Shikakai and Reetha Powder as shampoo -- and OH MY GOSH GUYS. My hair is soft, sleek, and moisturized, and it has that squeaky clean feeling. My hair has less breakage and it looks like it too!  

If you guys have not tried it, I highly recommend it. I also live in a college town with moderately hard water, and still dont need an acv rinse. I'm super excited that this is working out and that this is so much better than what I could've expected! I'm really surprised not more people are talking about it.

I've started nopoo for 2.5 months by only using baking soda and vinegar wash once ever two days (I seriously didn't know it's not recomended). My hair grew out so fast. All my life I've combatted hair thinning and this transition worked so well my hair has never been so thick! FYI I am asian with black straight hair and has thin hair genetics. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Then I went to the beach and gave into shampoo because I didn't have baking soda with me. That was for a week, then I came home and continued using shampoo because I was out of baking soda. I switched back to shampoo for 2 -3 weeks and finally came back to baking soda. It's still working - my hair is beautiful but it's not the same anymore as when I started. I'm one week back into baking soda &amp; vinegar and washing it once every 2-3 days, but I have been feeling that the baking soda maybe too strong for me, so today I tried just water and then dandruffs appeared right away.

I'm also going to dye my hair next week with chemical. I don't want natural alternative simply because I don't know how to get the right color and has no experience in dying it myself ever.

I am currently travelling around Asia and therefore I mostly only wash my hair with cold water. It never felt clean after a wash, actually just more oily. I try to really wash it and rub my scalp a lot. I also dry my hair with a t shirt instead of a towel. I see no difference.

I have thin hair, but because of my waves it doesn't look that way. In those two months it actually looks fine and full. It's just that the feel is very very very oily. I can not get with my fingers through my hair all the way from the scalp. I thought it was just part of the transition but yesterday I noticed very gross and thick layers of, as it looks like, fat/oil build up near my scalp that make my hairs get stuck to each other. I was able to brush those out with three different kind of brushes. A round soft brush, a tangle teezer and a fine comb. That made my whole hair more oily instead of mostly at the scalp. In those last two months I just used the soft round brush, maybe I couldn't reach my scalp that way and therefore the build up?

I am currently in India and it's kind of hard to get a BBB. Same for the shampoos without silicones or sulfates. So I'd rather go through this process without. Is that even possible? Will it just take longer and do I have to be patience? Or am I doing something wrong?

1. I use hair oils a lot, like Coconut oil, Almond oil, Argan oil etc.  and usually wash them out with a shampoo. How would I go about washing them out if I'm going nopoo? Or do I just rub my scalp with normal water and let the oils hopefully soak in and fade away naturally? And I usually condition too, is conditioning recommended during nopoo? And a certain kind? Or is any old conditioner fine?
2. I aim to dye my hair once I'm done with college, in about 2 months or so. I haven't admittedly read up on maintaining dyed hair and all yet since the act is still far off, but is it okay to go nopoo while having dyed hair?

The second day it already looks terrible, is super itchy, and I think it smells. I put up with it to avoid washing it every day, but it's frustrating and makes me uncomfortable, especially at work. I'm thinking of trying lowpoo and eventually transitioning to using no shampoo, but I don't know where to start.

I bought a dry shampoo yesterday just to try it out, but I know it's not a real fix.

I have a lot of hair, but it is very thin and frizzy. It's medium length and chestnut brown. Near my forehead, it's very rough and broken. I also live in a place with humidity averaging 75% (usually ranges from 60-85%), which makes dealing with oily hair more difficult.

4163,t3_bel08f,"I'm travelling at the moment and I want to give no poo a try. Let me first fill you in on some background. I have normal skin that tends towards dehydration. My scalp health is good too. No dandruff or other scalp problems. My hair length goes to my shoulders and I have a fringe. I'm blessed with curly hair but if there's lots of moisture in the hair it's frizzy af. I can only achieve my curly hair through product and if I want it to really bang, I need heat too. I've some blonde at the bottom half of my hair which is in good condition. I currently can get 5-6 days from each wash. My hair always looks it's best on day 3-4, because the natural oils dampen down the frizz and flyaways. I never use dry shampoo because I'm lazy. 

Now for my routine. Before I get into the shower, I run my fingers vigorously over my scalp for a few minutes. I find this is really helping with the itchiness. When I'm in the shower, I scrub my scalp under the hot water as if I'm washing my hair as usual. I'm not conditioning my hair shafts but I don't have any. I don't brush my hair because I've curly hair and it makes my hair frizzy. I've no idea if the water in the countries I visit have hard or soft water. I'm travelling through the middle East and Central Asia, with a single 40L bag, so I don't have a ton of space. 

I'm only 7 days in and I'm really feeling the grease. At the front of my head it's okay, but the back of my crown is flat with oil. Luckily I'm in a country that requires me to wear a headscarf but this won't be the case in a few days. I'm not at home so when I go to a shop to buy conditioner, I have no idea what I'm buying. The hair shafts are in good condition and I think I'm getting a good distribution of the oil through my hair, save for the back where it seems to be gathering. 

Now, I'm looking for some feedback on 2 fronts. How does my routine sound? How did you cope with the transition? Curly haired no poo people, how do you spread your hair's natural loveliness through to the ends without compromising your curl? Those who started when travelling, what did you do?

Finally, I Googled natural shampoos for SD and found WOW, an ACV shampoo on Amazon. Since my trouble was so immediate, I called my local beauty shop to see if they sold ACV shampoo and they didn’t, but suggested Whole Foods. I picked up Avalon Organics ACV shampoo and conditioner.

It’s all natural ingredients, no sulfates and other junk. I do have a little, tiny itch by my ears, so I might pre-treat with ACV/water mix before shampoo next time. Otherwise, my hair looks and feels great!!! Lots of body, no flyaways.. and, when I want to “go curly”, it’s not frizzy like it usually is.

4185,t3_bb633a,"Hi all,

I started nopoo ~4 months ago and I have very itchy scalp since 1,5 months.
When I was using industrial shampoo I also had this problem du to my very dry skin. I was shampooing every days and sometimes using one special shampoo for the itching and dry skin problem (like 3 special shampoo in a months).
Now my nopoo routine is once a week : 
- brown sugar massage
- almond oil (juste the tip of my fingers) + tea tree essential oil massage for 5 minutes
- shampoo with hot water, baking soda (half table spoon) and tea tree essential oil.
I established this routine thanks to the /r/nopoo wiki. My scalp is still very itchy and I often do a fast shampoo with hot water and tea tree essential oil in between shampoo instead of the hot water only. I wonder if I'm doing anything wrong ? Is it normal for the essential oil not to prevent itchiness during the whole week ?

By the way my hairs are short, my scalp is dry and the roots of my hairs can be oily but the tips are dry. I do no have dandruff, just dead skin du to the scratching...

Can anyone help or share its experience ?

4249,t3_b15zpg,"I've been water-only for something like a year... been using hybrid boar bristle brushes for even longer. They are fantastic, I love them, but I hate cleaning them, and since the brush is basically responsible for cleaning your hair rather than shampoo, it really needs to be kept clean to work properly.

I have been tweaking my routine for a while. I used to shampoo the brush, but I was always low-poo (once a week or less) and this really wasn't enough, plus it was very hard on the brush.

I used a metal comb on my brushes for a long time, (I think this was also hard on them) and occasionally take a dental pick and run it through the individual bunches of boar hair (I still haven't found anything else that will really get the stuck lint out of the bristle clusters).

This year I switched away from the metal comb and bought a hairbrush cleaning tool, with thick plastic bristles. This doesn't go between as effectively as the comb, but if I brush the surface of the brush, it gets nearly all of the smaller hairs that don't come off by hand, and it loosens the dust for the final stage... which is an electric duster (meant to replace compressed air cans for cleaning the computer).

So the hairbrush cleaner, plus air-blast approach seems to be working okay for me as a daily cleaning solution, with occasional deep cleaning by dental pick... it feels ridiculous to put so much thought/effort into maintaining a hairbrush, but when I slack off on it, I end up removing dust tangles from my hair... not to mention using a hairbrush that looks like the inside of a vacuum bag... *sigh*",NoPoo

I wash my hair once every 1.5 weeks with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, but I am trying to extend these stretches and eventually transition to no-poo. I do not wet my hair between washes. I also have an extremely sensitive scalp, and I had sebborheic  dermatitis and exczema as a child, which I grew out of. 

I am fairly certain I have hard water and am aware that water only is not an option for me. At about the 1 week mark of no washing, my scalp becomes extremely sensitive and painful to the touch, and I can barely tie it up or even part it.

I use aloe vera twice a week overnight and rinse with apple cider vinegar (acv). Any other time in the week that I need to get rid of any oily hair (doesn’t happen often) I rinse with acv. 

I still blow dry and straighten with a hot brush. 

I also brush my hair every morning and night with a boar bristle brush for about 5 minutes. My shoulder length hair is growing fast, and the hair I lost from the SD seems to be growing back. 

I color my hair to cover grays, and the color doesn’t sting my scalp any longer and since I’m a redhead and color red/auburn, it’s no longer brassy. My hair takes the color and it’s a beautiful auburn that looks so natural no one can tell I’ve colored even5 minutes after I’m done.

I wash about twice a week with about 1/2-1 tsp baking soda and rinse with a splash of white vinegar. I felt like my hair was doing great - until I took a bath a week ago, which is something I don't usually do. I did my normal wash routine but in the bath (there was no soap in the water). Afterwards, I put a small pump of argon oil in my wet hair as it was feeling a bit dry. I then proceeded to get about 4 inches cut off my hair.

I didn't let the stylist use any products on my hair. But after it dried my hair was - well, it's hard to describe. Almost sticky?..I can't run my fingers through it anymore. And, overall, it's just looking bleh. 

I thought maybe somehow washing it in the bath messed it up (I have no idea how, but just trying to make some sense of it!).

4266,t3_axo86g,"Hey all, I've been basically shampoo free for about 9 years. I wanted to offer some thoughts and advice, because I have seen lots of posts by people just starting, or who have done it for a year or two, but not much from people like me, who've done it many years.

First, my qualifications. I first heard of the notion of not using shampoo a long time ago, and thought it made sense, so figured I'd try it. Worst case scenario it didn't work and I'd go back to shampooing every other shower. It did work, and I haven't stopped. I've had everything from shoulder length hair to buzz cut, so I have experience with varying lengths.

I say I've been basically shampoo free, because I will still occasionally use shampoo. I do a lot of projects, woodworking, tinkering on my old lawn tractor, brickwork/masonry, and other messy hobbies. Every once in a while, my hair gets too dirty for just water, and I will use shampoo. I have used shampoo probably no more than 4-6 times in the past 9 years. I am not opposed to using shampoo when it is needed, I just am not using it on a constant basis.

My routine is straightforward. I don't have extremely oily hair, which may be from not using shampoo for so long. I generally shower every 2-4 days on average, depending on the weather and my activity level. Summer I may shower every day, in winter when I'm not leaving the house, it may be 4-5 days. I know, that is along stretch to go between showers. I'm a stay-at-home dad of four young kids, and some weeks I don't do enough to warrant showering more often. I smell myself before my wife does, and she tells me if she ever smells me. Don't judge...

Anyway, when I shower, usually in the evening, I get my head under the water and scrub my hair and scalp with my fingernails. I use my nails to exfoliate my scalp, and use my fingers to wash out anything that might have gotten in my hair. I'm not talking about scratching my scalp till it hurts or bleeds, just giving it a good scalp massage/scratch. When I get out, I towel dry, and will give it a quick comb if it's long enough. That's it. No egg yolks, mayo, yogurt, baking soda, vinegar, etc...

Now, I've seen a lot of posts saying their hair is 'oily', and I'm not really sure what the posters mean. When I run my hands through my hair, there will be a slight feeling of oil on my hands. That is normal. That is what hair does. It makes some oil to protect the hair shafts from drying out, and keep the hair healthy and voluminous. We want that oil, which is why we stop stripping our hair with shampoo.

It is very similar to the coating of oil on a cast iron pan. If you are unfamiliar with this notion, it is like this. After using a cast iron pan, you want to put a thin coating of oil on the iron to protect the pan. Most people will pour a little oil in the pan, then use a paper towel to wipe out the excess oil. When finished, there are not pools of oil in the pan, just a nice, even, thin sheen. If you rub your palm across the pan, your palm will also have a thin coating of oil. Thin enough that you could probably just rub it in your hands like lotion and it would disappear.

Similarly, if you run your hands through your hair, you will feel a small amount of natural oils on your fingers. To me it feel like that very last bit of lotion that gets trapped between your fingers, and you have to get your thumb or other fingers down at the base to get it out. That's what my hands feel like after running my fingers through my hair, and that is not 'oily hair' that is natural hair.

I do not generally need hair products, gels, hair spray, or the like, because generally my hair is short enough I don't need it. When I do need it though, I will use it. I don't change my routine to get it out either. I may spend just a few more minutes washing my hair to get it all out. Generally though, natural hair shouldn't be bothered by hair products, unless you are using them to excess.

If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer as best I can.

TLDR: I've been doing this a long time, you (frankly) probably don't need many of the ""alternatives"" that are pushed, and some oil in your hair is normal and nothing to be worried about.",NoPoo

4268,t3_axl8uv,"Hi! I've been happily no poo for over 2 years now. I use Hesh powders (Aritha, Shikakai, Amla, Brahmi and Rose) to clean my hair once a week, then put coconut oil on regularly to moisturise.

However they have a couple ingredients I'm not sure about Cetyl alcohol and BTMS. I've googled them and they seem harmless but I wondered if anyone had any more information or opinions on these ingredients. I wouldn't want to ruin the progress I've made with my hair but I could do with some more hydration.

I have been washing my hair with baking soda and rinsing it with ACV afterwards. About 10 times in total during those 80 days.

My hair is very fine, about butt length and gets greasy very soon. If I wanted to have nice looking hair, I would have to wash it daily.
This is the main reason I descided to do nopoo. The greas is overkill!

However, now, 80 days later, the grease is still as it used to be. I wash it and less than 24 hours later it is very very greasy again.

I have gotten used to it, wear it in a bun or with a scarf, so I don't mind. But I expected a faster adaptation, to be honest.

I am not thinking about giving up, though. I'm going to continue with this, as my hair looks better overall, has less split ends and the maintenance is the cheapest ever.

On top of this, I have sobria on my face (my whole family has it, even though all of our diets are very different), so my skin is already extremely dry. I’ve had to put aveeno lotion on my face every day to stop peeling/redness. Since I grew a short beard, with these dry skin problems it means I’m also battling endless beard dandruff/flakes, Which I am able to keep at bay most of the time by rubbing aveeno into the skin beneath my beard. (I’ve tried beard oils, and mixing coconut oil products with Argan oils and have not found anything that has worked besides aveeno).

4288,t3_aveatm,"Hi--

I am a female with hair almost to my butt, definitely at my waist. My hair type is pretty much straight and fine, though I have a lot of hair. I am Polish, so I have the typical dark blonde/light brown color naturally that is getting darker with the oiliness--which I don't mind! My question is, on day 11 of water only, how much longer can I expect to have such nasty oily hair? It isn't terrible, I can pull it off with my hair in a bun or low pony tail, but the color change combined with the added weight is making it obvious. I'm down to power through it, but I would like to hear form others who had similar experiences how long this phase lasted.

&amp;#x200B;

My current routine (though I'm modifying as needed as I learn):

AM: 

\-slept with hair in a long plait/braid, used wide tooth comb to get any knots out

\-used boar brush with my head flipped over, then did an extra pass on my ends to make sure the oil gets down the long length

\-put it in a bun because I look like a sea monster

PM:

\-shower with a cap on

\-same brush routine as the AM, but I spritz a tea tree/peppermint essential oil toner (that I made) on my scalp to keep the flakes and funk at bay (I'm really happy with how this is working out)

\-usually braid it or toss it into a topknot to sleep

\-LAST NIGHT ONLY: did a water only rinse for the first time, my hair seemed like it was drying well then I put it in a bun when it was 90% dry (hoping for some easy waves in the morning, when I used shampoo this was my go-to), when I woke up my hair was noticeably less oily looking. Felt about the same, but it looked better. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main questions are how much longer until my scalp re-calibrates and how often should I do water only rinses? Will 2 days in a row be too often?

I heard finasteride helps with hair loss but has bad side effects like ED/limp dick.  I also heard Rogaine works great but if I stop I'd lose the hair grown from it within 3-6 months.

Hey there,

So I recently came across lots of posts about people's journeys and I thought I'd actually contribute, since certain groups of us run into the same problems and it's also nice to hear what others think and to have direct advice. Since I'm new to this subreddit, let me know if I should correct anything (format, etc.)

Hair: shoulder-length, straight and very dark (Asian), on the finer side but I do have a lot of it, so I have a pretty full head of hair. 

I tried giving up on shampoo a few years back and used a honey/ cinnamon mix once every week. My hair was so dead and grey that I gave up after 6 weeks and tried using a natural shampoo bar that was also meant to be used once a week, but it felt waxy and didn't change the fact that my hair felt dense and heavy, and there was a lot of build-up. This was all due to hard water, and since I didn't want to invest in a filter, I just went back to cheap and crappy shampoo.

Due to me picking up a sport, I started washing my hair every day, and I knew it was so bad for it. Bear in mind that my hair has always looked okay on the outside. The only aesthetic issue I had was that, due to all the washing, my hair would get so greasy very quickly. Then I started to think about how much I was wasting as well as the fact that constant shampooing is genuinely something that was recently deeply drilled into us as a necessity, when in fact (in the greater scheme of things) it isn't. 

So, I decided to try again.

Firstly, I slowly cut down the length of time between washes (every other day for 2 weeks, every 3 days for 2/3 weeks, twice a week for 2 weeks, then I stopped)

1st 2 weeks of no poo: green tea to ""scrub"" my scalp and hair, followed by black tea as a rinse (I think I read somewhere that the former was alkaline and the latter acidic and I thought I could achieve a 5.5ish pH balance) and just normal hard water to wash it out at the end.

This was perfectly good, since I used a boar bristle brush every night, that I also regularly cleaned. I washed my hair twice a week and it still had a good amount of volume. However, there was still build-up in my hair and towards the end of the second week, my hair started getting dense and grey again.

Very unhappy, I looked into managing that and found that making my acidic rinse more acidic (with lemon juice) should help. And it really did! My hair is no longer waxy, but on the other hand it is far too conditioned; it gets oily really quickly (within a day), though the oil is well distributed throughout the hair. So I reduced the amount of lemon (1 squeezed lemon in about 700ml of black tea instead of two), and this is my third day of oily hair, but oily in a manageable sense.

At the moment, I don’t really want to buy a water filter for my showerhead, but I do use my parents’ filter jug and then boil the water for the tea. Do you think I should go back to limiting the amount of days between washes gradually, or that I should reduce the amount of lemon in the black tea? Also, is saltwater (I use dead sea salt solution to treat my eczema) good for making hair a less oily? Or will that also encourage your scalp to overproduce?

Though I had a bit of a hiccough with the hard water, I do really believe that the lemon helped a huge amount. My boar bristle brush has barely any grey fluff/ waxy bits from brushing my hair, and I feel like my hair is at least evenly oily, instead of greasy at the roots and dry at the ends.

When it comes to how my hair looks, a couple of people have commented on how it looks healthier, but bear in mind that this no poo journey is the only time I’ve properly cared for my hair. From about 12 until 20, I didn’t even own a hairbrush (though my hair was midway down my torso at one point) and I never cared about how it looked, other than if it was too greasy – so I never, ever used conditioner, though in hindsight that probably would have made my head less oily. So now that I brush my hair daily, of course I’m crazy glad not to find my hair everywhere at home, but I don’t know if I’m just shedding it all into my brush, given that I never used to brush my hair. Also, even though I used to dye and bleach my hair a lot, I refused to use a hairdryer out of principle (my mum keeps telling me that going outside with wet hair will give me a cold, so I’ve been doing it in even -5 Celsius just to prove her wrong – successfully, may I add), so I don’t think my hair was that damaged beforehand.

I just really hate how we’ve been tricked into believing that shampoos are this giant necessity and then we go through our entire adult lives forced to shell out money and contribute to waste to avoid having “dirty” hair. Even if the no poo thing doesn’t work out in the long run, I really hope never to go back to washing my hair more than twice a week, and definitely not every day!

tl; dr: Asian hair, no poo with hard water for 3 weeks, at first using green tea followed by black was fine, but it did nothing for my build-up and so I added lemon juice to the black tea and now my hair gets greasy very easily, albeit evenly so and at least without the nasty waxiness from hard water.

My crown is pretty oily, but the rest of my hair is starting to feel very soft. I do get a little bit of static lift on the ends, however.
I brush in all directions, about 100 strokes every night. I have only washed twice thus far, both times soaking in a bath in the hopes that some of my flakes will float free, and then followed with a shower and COLD rinse to seal the cuticle.

1. I don't understand how to clean my boar bristle brush. It looks DISGUSTING after I brush; ashy and waxy.
2. I have a lot of flakes that will not come out of my hair. I ""scritch and preen"", but it just seems to make more. I cannot tell if it is dandruff or dry scalp because the flakies stick to my sticky, oily hair. How do I get rid of them?
I had this problem when I did regular washing before, and even when I shaved my head I still had flakes!

4307,t3_assc8e,"Hey all, I've been basically shampoo free for about 9 years. I wanted to offer some thoughts and advice, because I have seen lots of posts by people just starting, or who have done it for a year or two, but not much from people like me, who've done it many years.

First, my qualifications. I first heard of the notion of not using shampoo a long time ago, and thought it made sense, so figured I'd try it. Worst case scenario it didn't work and I'd go back to shampooing every other shower. It did work, and I haven't stopped. I've had everything from shoulder length hair to buzz cut, so I have experience with varying lengths. 

I say I've been basically shampoo free, because I will still occasionally use shampoo. I do a lot of projects, woodworking, tinkering on my old lawn tractor, brickwork/masonry, and other messy hobbies. Every once in a while, my hair gets too dirty for just water, and I will use shampoo.  I have used shampoo probably no more than 4-6 times in the past 9 years. I am not opposed to using shampoo when it is needed, I just am not using it on a constant basis. 

My routine is straightforward.  I don't have extremely oily hair, which may be from not using shampoo for so long.  I generally shower every 2-4 days on average, depending on the weather and my activity level.  Summer I may shower every day, in winter when I'm not leaving the house, it may be 4-5 days. I know, that is along stretch to go between showers. I'm a stay-at-home dad of four young kids, and some weeks I don't do enough to warrant showering more often.  I smell myself before my wife does, and she tells me if she ever smells me. Don't judge...

Anyway, when I shower, usually in the evening, I get my head under the water and scrub my hair and scalp with my fingernails. I use my nails to exfoliate my scalp, and use my fingers to wash out anything that might have gotten in my hair. I'm not talking about scratching my scalp till it hurts or bleeds, just giving it a good scalp massage/scratch. 
When I get out, I towel dry, and will give it a quick comb if it's long enough. That's it. No egg yolks, mayo, yogurt, baking soda, vinegar, etc...

Now, I've seen a lot of posts saying their hair is 'oily', and I'm not really sure what the posters mean. When I run my hands through my hair, there will be a slight feeling of oil on my hands. That is normal. That is what hair does. It makes some oil to protect the hair shafts from drying out, and keep the hair healthy and voluminous. We want that oil, which is why we stop stripping our hair with shampoo.  

It is very similar to the coating of oil on a cast iron pan. If you are unfamiliar with this notion, it is like this. After using a cast iron pan, you want to put a thin coating of oil on the iron to protect the pan. Most people will pour a little oil in the pan, then use a paper towel to wipe out the excess oil. When finished, there are not pools of oil in the pan, just a nice, even, thin sheen. If you rub your palm across the pan, your palm will also have a thin coating of oil. Thin enough that you could probably just rub it in your hands like lotion and it would disappear. 

Similarly, if you run your hands through your hair, you will feel a small amount of natural oils on your fingers. To me it feel like that very last bit of lotion that gets trapped between your fingers, and you have to get your thumb or other fingers down at the base to get it out. That's what my hands feel like after running my fingers through my hair, and that is not 'oily hair' that is natural hair. 

I do not generally need hair products, gels, hair spray, or the like, because generally my hair is short enough I don't need it.  When I do need it though, I will use it.  I don't change my routine to get it out either.  I may spend just a few more minutes washing my hair to get it all out. Generally though, natural hair shouldn't be bothered by hair products, unless you are using them to excess. 

If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer as best I can. 

TLDR: I've been doing this a long time, you (frankly) probably don't need many of the ""alternatives"" that are pushed, and some oil in your hair is normal and nothing to be worried about. ",NoPoo
4308,t3_asrhir,"I went no 'poo a few years ago, in my late 20s, and immediately jumped straight to the bs/acv method. This worked for a couple years and then my hair went...bleh. I've always had very long hair (sometimes I can sit on it, though now I keep it more waist-length), average thickness (my braid is not quite as wide as my wrist, if that helps) and very soft. But with the baking soda once a week and boar bristle brushing every night, it wound up impossibly dry and unmanageable right after washing, passable the next day and downhill greasy the rest of the week. Even coconut oil wasn't helping. 

I switched back to shampoo, using sulfate-free ones with 'cone-free conditioners. I've tried several times in all this to go water only, the usual method being to gradually top the shampoo bottle with water. This always works great until I've used up the very last of the suds, then no amount of standing under the water and scrubbing and brushing does anything. My hair takes hours to dry on its own, anyway, and I usually give up and hit it with the blowdryer just to confirm what I already knew: the hard water left it greasy and waxy. On the rare occasions I've been somewhere with soft water, like on vacation, I've had the same grease problem without the wax. I'm currently using Carol's Daughter, which is price-y, but the results are great. 

I still follow my conditioner up with a rinse made of ACV and distilled water to remove buildup, but can't go more than 3 days without washing. I've also tried WO with ACV and still had the greasy problem. 

Now, I'm a full-time, stay-at-home aunt (for a sister who works at a daycare she can't afford), and I've been using my toddler niece and nephew for hair experiments since I'm invariably the one available at bath time. Previously, they'd both been using a hypoallergenic sulfate shampoo twice a week and a bit of my 'cone free vo5 conditioner, but one day I decided to go water only. 

Results: Niece, age 4, who has very fine shoulder-length hair with a slight wave, is able to up to a week without even rinsing, and it still doesn't look greasy. ACV, however, leaves it a bit limp. 

Nephew, age 2, extremely thick curly hair that hangs to his shoulders when wet is also able to go a week between rinses, ACV once a month helps combat any small amount of buildup that might be hiding in there and keeps his scalp smelling fresh. 

Again, we have hard water but neither of them are having any problem staying clean. Is this just an age thing because I started it so early on them and it's just too late for me, or is there some other trick I haven't tried?

I tried everything - prescription strength shampoo, drugstore shampoo, natural remedies like ACV, lemon juice etc, monistat anti-fungal cream, 8-9 kinds of oils, washing hair daily, washing hair weekly, shampoo bars etc. You get get the idea. 90% of these remedies did nothing, the other 10% worked but either left my hair as dry as a straw or stopped working after a few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I was utterly desperate and mentioned my problem to my massage therapist in Jan 2018. I have TMJ and get medical massage for head/neck/jaw area and I was super embarrassed to go to my therapist and have her rub her hands all over my nasty scalp. I told her about my problem and requested that she use gloves. She then mentioned that she studied Rosemary in her natural healing class and people swore by it.

 Being desperate, I tried it as instructed by her and voila! It worked! Instructions below.

1. Buy dried rosemary (online or whole foods).
2. Bring 3 cups of filtered water to a boil.
3. Add 2-3 tsp rosemary, preferably in a teabag/stainless steel tea ball thingy and reduce to the heat to a simmer.
4. Simmer the tea/rinse for 20-30 min.
5. Turn off the stove and let the rosemary steep, covered, for a few hours (optional for max efficacy).
6. Remove the rosemary and transfer the liquid to a spray bottle for easy application. Please use an amber/dark blue glass bottle (cheap on Amazon) to safely store the volatile oils/compounds in the rinse.

How to use: Use it all the time until you get rid of the flakes.

1. I use as a pre-wash treatment - spray all over scalp and hair liberally. It should saturate the scalp especially. I wait 30-60 min or even overnight depending oh how well I plan my day.
2. I also use it as a post-wash rinse - pour the rinse all over the hair in the shower post-wash as the final step. Rinse with water.
3. I also use it as leave-in - spray the scalp liberally and lightly on the hair after you get out of the shower on damp hair.
4. I use as needed on dry hair if I feel itchy. Simply spray on scalp and leave in.

FYI - I double the recipe and store in the fridge with a couple spoons of vodka in the rinse as a mild preservative. It usually keeps for 2 weeks.

I have been doing this for a year and my scalp is so healthy and flake-free. I did a very intensive daily treatment for 2 weeks to get my scalp under control and now I am at maintenance - usually a weekly application. The other great thing is the side-effects have been all positive - less frizz, skin looks fab because I usually also spritz my face with it. 

I bought a large 1 LB bag of organic Rosemary from Mountain Rose Herbs a year ago (no affiliation) and I still have a ton left. I am thrilled. This solution is so cheap, easy and safe. 

Variations: After telling everyone about this, my friends and family have reported back with their own recipes and all of them have worked well. See below:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Using fresh rosemary also works great. My friend lives in a warm climate and grows rosemary all year round in her yard. 
2. Not simmering or steeping - my cousin lives in a dorm at college and doesn't have a stove to do this. She simply microwaves water in large mug, adds the rosemary and tosses the tea bag 10-15 min later. She doesn't transfer it to a bottle either, she just dumps the entire mug on her head in the shower. 
3. The quantity is very forgiving - some use less/more. Still works.

Anyway, I hope this helps someone. Buy a small packet and try it. As mentioned above, I got a proper diagnosis for SD from a dermatologist, who funnily enough, laughed at this cure when I asked her before trying. Oh well, just happy it worked for me.

EDIT : how often should i wash/wet my hair per week?",NoPoo
4331,t3_aoydry,"### My routine:
I use water only, cold when I'm in a place with hard water and hot when I'm somewhere with soft water (or somewhere with hard water that doesn't cause hair problems – more on this below). I scrub my hair and scalp pretty vigorously for a few minutes, as if I were using shampoo. I wash my hair like this every day. I don't use a brush or comb at all. My hair is short (&lt;1-5""). I've been doing water-only for about 4 years.

I eased into water-only by slowing using more and more ""natural"" hair products over the course of a few years. So I used normal shampoo -&gt; natural shampoo -&gt; baking soda -&gt; water only + occasional shampoo/baking soda to deal with hard water -&gt; water only. I never had a transition phase.

### Hard water
Hard water contains various, depending on region, dissolved minerals. The dissolved minerals bind to sebum to make really unpleasant sticky, white, waxy buildup. It can make your hair feel and look stiff and wet. It's not clear which minerals cause these problems (although my best guess is calcium). I've lived in various places with hard water and only some of them caused the stiffness/stickiness problem.

You should be able to look up your water hardness online. Your water utility [US] is required to make water testing data available, which includes info about dissolved mineral content. There are also maps that highlight regions with soft/hard water. However, keep in mind that the cutoff for hard water is subjective. The real measure of water hardness is if your water is causing you any hair problems. If you're rinsing/washing with water only and your hair starts to develop sticky white stuff, then you have hard-enough water.

I've found that this can be alleviated (amazingly!) by washing exclusively with cold water. It really does work :) When I switched to using cold water, my waxy buildup problems went away in a week of washing every day, so, 7 washes. So you should be able to tell in a short period of time whether cold water is working for you.

Sebum melts around 91°F (33°C). I hypothesize that when it melts the dissolved minerals in hard water get trapped and make that sticky white residue. Hence, if you wash with water cooler than 91°F, your sebum won't soften and won't get minerals mixed in with it.

### What you should do
First, see if you actually have this buildup problem with water-only. Like I said above, in my experience there are a lot of places with supposedly hard water that don't cause problems for me (maybe due to high dissolved minerals, but low dissolved calcium?).

If you *do* have buildup problems, you can address it in various ways:

* Wash with cold water.
* Wash with rain water.
* Wash with distilled water, not tap water.
* Use a shampoo or shampoo alternative every once in a while (every 2 weeks-2 months) to take out the mineral buildup, and do water-only for your day-to-day washes.
* Rinse with something acidic (vinegar is popular, lemon juice and citric acid should both work too). (I haven't tried this myself, but some people say it works.)
* Get a water softener system or water-softening shower head (some contain vitamin C that you have to replenish every so often). (I haven't tried this myself, but some people say it works. I've also seen some websites claim that shower heads can't soften water – they don't have enough contact time with it, basically.)

Lastly, if you're just starting off, I wouldn't worry about this stuff right now. Getting through the transition phase is the first struggle. Once that's done, if you're still having hair problems (dandruff, buildup, dryness, etc etc), look into different shampoo alternatives/changes to your routine to address those specific problems. I didn't even realize hard water was a problem until 1.5 years into low 'poo.",NoPoo

4333,t3_aojhcf,"One month in, no shampooing!

Okay backstory: my hair was falling at an alarming rate after shampooing. I had an itchy, scratchy scalp. Insane dandruff! Insane!
I was trying all sorts of oils and shampoos but nothing worked either for the itch/dandruff or for the hairfall. Then i found out about how shampoos rob our scalp of natural oils.

January 8th was the last time i oiled/shampooed my hair.

Now many here are doing only water which i dont think is right. Just Water cant remove grime. I wash my hair two or three times a week. Once with just water. Once an egg mask. I apply 2-3 egg yolks on my scalp and keep for half an hour. Then i rinse with cold water. I also do a yogurt mask once a week. (I told this to someone here earlier and he thought it was a joke, but it’s not.) Hung curd is basically plain yogurt drained of all water. You dont want to apply yogurt without draining the water else it would keep dripping all over your face. You can use a muslin cloth to do that. Apply for 30, wash with cold. Hair feels amazing. Of course, you gotta use plain yogurt not black fucking currant.

Now because of all these organic applications your head might smell a bit so take half a lemon, squeeze it in a bowl and once you’ve rinsed off the mask apply that lemon juice on your scalp. Keep it for a minute and then wash with cold. Think of it like a conditioner. Another great conditioner is onion juice. Will remove any smells and helps with dandruff too. Plus the sulfur in it is supposed to encourage hair growth.

My hairfall has reduced significantly. I’m no longer scratching my head like an idiot. The dandruff is still there but i would say it has gone down by half, at least. One last thing, switch to a wooden comb. Plastic combs generate static while brushing and our hair stick to the teeth and break away. No such problem with wooden combs.",NoPoo
4334,t3_aommax,"Hi all,

I started water only recently and am struggling with greasiness in the transition phase. I have fine, long and wavy hair and my area has soft water.

I understand I’m going through the transition phase and need to be patient.  But I thought I would at least see a reduction in grease after washing? I don’t understand how it will improve over time if nothing I’m doing is removing grease? Am I doing something wrong?

1.	Brush your hair every morning and night and just before a shower. NEVER brush your hair when it's wet!

My dry scalp has been awful for a long time, and the dry environment I live in doesn't help. Exfoliating hasn't helped much, and I found most exfoliants needed to be shampooed out so I couldn't use them often anyway. I noticed my scalp behaved better after hair masks so figured adding moisture would be a good idea. I finally decided to try making a small spray bottle with a blend of:

* some fresh aloe gel (none of the yellow juice from the peel, just the clear gel from inside, and I used a leaf's worth so about 2tbsp but I'm going to start buying a pure gel so I don't kill my plant lol, recommendations welcome)
* good, clean witch hazel (a couple ounces or so)
* a bit of water (probably 3 ounces ish)

The exact proportions don't seem to matter much, for my personal results anyway.

After each wash but before applying leave-in conditioners/serums, I shake up the spray, divide my hair, and drench the hell out of my roots/scalp with it, then massage it in a bit. The very first time I used it, it did wonders for my dry scalp starting INSTANTLY! I also realized quickly that it seems to help control oil production, too, and I went from needing to co-wash about three times a week to only needing to do it once a week. That also happened essentially instantly!

I also started spraying it on (more lightly though, sometimes just on the really itchy/flaky areas) every day on dry hair, not just after washes. So far, I have never yet hit a point where this mixture dried heavily or left residue on my head, and I've put on a LOT of it at a time/over days. I have very fine strands, a fair bit of volume but the strands are super fine and get weighed down easily, so I think if this is drying down clean/weightless on me (especially going a week of uses at a time!) then it should probably do so on just about everyone.

I've been using this for about a month now. My dry scalp isn't totally gone but it's radically better than it was, the itching is a million times better, and the oil control benefit has stayed steady. One time when I didn't have aloe I just used the witch hazel, and the oil production stayed low but the flakes were more present; another time I didn't have witch hazel and just used the aloe, and that time the flakes were better but the oil production moved a bit more toward my-old-normal that week. Take from that anecdotal evidence what you will, and invent something that's perfect for you!

I'm really amazed by how easy this is, how well it works, and how cheap it is, and I really wish I'd tried it years ago. I reallyreallyreally hope this idea helps people out there. As far as I'm concerned, this tool should be in everyone's toolbox!",NoPoo

I started the no poo method in late July of last year and after a couple weeks of having very oily/waxy texture, my hair transitioned into a desirable texture that felt very clean with a minimal but still present amount of oil that allowed me to style my hair.

* 27 days without touching a shampoo bottle, aaauuugggh. Since then I've been WO, and keeping my hair up in a ponytail on oily days. Which is most of the time.
* Scalp is still in oily phase but seems to have started producing less of it on its own. I'm not sure if I'm imagining it, or if I'm just used to the oiliness by now.
* Scritching **definitely** produces less oil from about two weeks in. First time I scritched, my hair went from completely clean to soaked and gross in less than a minute. Now it doesn't overreact any more.
* I kept thinking I wasn't distributing the oils down to my ends because my ends always felt dry, but after brushing charcoal residue through my hair that one time (to try reduce odor) and finding it completely soaking the brush it became pretty clear that yes, the oils really *do* stick to the brush very easily, and should therefore be sticking to my ends too.
* A week later I discovered ""hair dusting"", a method to reduce split ends without losing length. Found out that my ends aren't dry -- **the feeling of dryness came from split ends**. Dusting them significantly reduced the dry feeling.
* Been having odor problems for ten days. **It's definitely a bad smell.** So I've been WO washing my hair often the last week to try and keep it under control without resorting to charcoal, baking soda or shampoo -- at most I can only reduce it.
* Scalp started itching a week in, went down at about the three week mark.
* Had dandruff from about a week in -- it doesn't flake off the scalp when I scratch it, it's just there. When I see it I dig the BBB out.
* Today I found some tea tree oil spray at Coles so I sprayed my scalp and BBB, and had a good scritch and distributed it through my hair. Still slight smell, but a significant amount was reduced.
* Going to keep up the tea tree each day for the rest of the oily phase. Hopefully, the smell will go when the oily phase does... not looking forward to what I should do if it doesn't. I don't want to wind up having to measure out baking soda/ACV or eggs or whatever it is non-WO no-poo people do; seems to defeat the entire point of going WO if I'm dealing with a huge hassle like that. IDK, I'll cross that bridge when I come to it!
* **Hair is softer**. Like. Really soft. In the last week it's actually been pretty silky.
* **Volume is reduced**. My hair has always been very fine, and never had volume -- I've always relied on shampooing it, and having it dry in certain positions for volume. Without shampoo it's very flat and thin.
* I know I should be grossed out but I find it hilarious that on my oiliest days, I can take out my pony tail and the pony tail will just... stay. These are high ponytails, btw, not nape-of-the-neck ones. It just stays and I can even swish it around and it'll just hold, omfg. I have to actually tousle my hair to get it out. It's hilarious because my hair used to never hold anything for shit.

I'll give another update in a week or two. Figured this might be useful for other people considering it, or still going through their own oily phases.",NoPoo

&gt;  The method I use in that case, is I wash the ends only and then use a boar hair bristle brush and my hands to distribute the oil from my scalp down the shaft.

(Context at link)

Wanted to put this forward for more discussion.

The method I'd read about how to wash WO is:

* Scritch
* Preen
* BBB
* Wash hair under shower by scritching scalp under warm water

So basically -- still washing the scalp and getting rid of oils.

But like, has anybody done it /u/weeblewobble82's way -- not just to try and reduce the oiliness during the oily phase, but as a WO habit to maintain post-oily phase? Instead of washing the scalp?

It seems to make sense to me that it might be a better idea to just leave the scalp alone entirely outside of scritching, and to preen under water instead of scritching. But I don't know if that contributes to odor or oiliness or what.

&amp;#x200B;

Like the title says I'm going no poo for the first time in my life. I (18 M) have thick curly hair and Im looking for a healthier curl. I bought maneline's shampoo, and after using for half a week my hair started to become very thick and leathery. I understand the adjustment phase and I have noticed that it feels ""healthy"" however it has so much weight to it, when it dries its just a big bushy mess ( especially If I run my hands through it)

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to know for the other curly hair redditors what your routines are/ what products you reccomend to make a light and free flowing curl that holds its moisture. My hair is also dry as can be 8/10 dryness. I linked the shampoo for those that are curious.

&amp;#x200B;

recently I have tried using and egg yolk to clarify my hair, and that worked really well to make it feel very clean, however it almost feels the same as if I used a shampoo

Routine: I get in the shower ( always look warm) I wet my hair and use a soft tipped scalp brush to massage a small amount of maneline shampoo evenly throughout my hair. I let that sit for 2-3minutes and then gently rinse it out while running my hands through it. I then either air dry or use a pillow case to slowly rub my hair dry. more recently I used a yolk to rinse out build up in my hair.

Goals: solid routine to get defined curls with minimal frizz. Going for soft flowing hair as well.

TLDR: looking for a good routine to get free flowing curl that holds its moisture. what products or home remedies do you recommend?

Been no-poo consistently for about 7 years now, currently using African Black soap. So cheap, use it for my body and my hair, and it's wonderful. I make it softer with coconut oil or my beauty store mango styling gel that has jojoba oil and the like in it. 

I've got black, coarse Asian hair, so not sure how much my methods would help people, but I really just went cold turkey. One of the few good things from my mother was her getting me to go no-poo, hence why its been 7 years. Originally, I just used bar soap, and with my short hair it worked. 

Started using black african soap last year, it's really nice and exfoliating. Have to be causeful not to get too sudsy or else it really burns in my eyes. Coconut oil is super good for making my hair soft, but it definitely looks greasy right after I put it on.

The recipe starts with you mixing

° Rye Flour and Water

The ratio to mix it is 1:2 ( for every spoon of rye flour you add 2 spoons of water )

° Mix it fully until a liquid paste forms

° When washing leave it for a few minutes and then rinse until clean

° After that use Apple Cider to avoid dryness 

° At the end use a brush to remove any of the flour that is still on the hair

4384,t3_agwd6k,"I've always liked the idea, but am not convinced about the reality. I've been co-washing for a while and that's been working well, but would like to full on commit to water only.

However, I'm not convinced about the scientific basis of no poo. From what I've read, most proponents state that scalp starts producing less oil as it gets ""used"" to not being stripped of grease every few days. TBH, to me this sounds questionable (don't take this as an attack, I just think it's good  to challenge stuff). How would the skin cells and the hair follicle even monitor sebum levels?

**Is there any actual peer reviewed research into this, and where did the idea come from in the first place?**

Even if there's not and even if the above theory is wrong, that's less important than whether no poo works even for another reason.

Which brings me to question 2. All you people who have really nice hair from no poo; Is it actually ***nicer*** than when you used shampoo and conditioner, about the same, or worse but still fine? Because one of my friends has been ""no pooing"" for 6 years or so, and her hair looks fine. But it still sometimes looks a little waxy and greasy (especially now it's longer). So is your hair better than it was before? Or is no poo just a low maintenance way for hair to look OK.

Would super appreciate any insight!

After my first wash using this shampoo bar, I rinsed with boiled water (the water in most of the UK is very hard), but my hair felt quite grippy and waxy, but not greasy. I didn't mind, as usually my hair lacks volume as it is very fine and straight.

On the website, they suggest doing a ACV rinse after using the shampoo bar.

Our plumbing in the house we are renting backs up if you look at it wrong, and the tub took a loooong time to drain out today.

To avoid shoving flour down our sensitive drain all the time, I was thinking about making some sort of tea. Like soak or cook the flour and use the liquid and not the solid. Do any of you do this? Cold soak or hot infusion? Do you put it on your head all watery or do you reduce it down to a thicker consistency? Do you feel it cleans as well as actual rye flour?

I feel like hot would get more of the good good out but my hair is loving the protein and I don't want to disturb the protein structures in the rye flour with heat. Also...would the water even have protein in it? I have doubts about it because of fake meat. Old school recipes for making seitan (a meat replacement) involve washing wheat flour in water. Repeated exposure to water removes any gluten until only the protein remains. Would this also be an issue? Like, would rye water be everything but the protein I want?

4416,t3_ad7uyy,"Hey NoPoo

I've been currently without soap about 3+ years now, using exclusively cold water on my hair for about a year. 

My guide to surviving the cold:
Start warm, but don't rinse your hair with hot water. ONLY use cold water in your hair. Warm water opens pores in your hair, allowing more adsorption of oils. Only using cold water will shock your hair, freeing oils more than usual. Water will get most of the oil out, and any excess should be taken up in a healthy amount once your hair warms up. When you scrub, rinse your hands often. NoPoo is a physical cleaning method and reducing oils on your hands makes it more effective. Use water as cold as you can go. It'll be rough at first, but if you stay consistent you'll get used to it. Cold showers are honestly very refreshing. 

As far as frequency, everyone is different. It will depend on your activity levels and experience with no shampoo. Pay attention to what you do each day and find what works. Personally, I will at least wet my hair daily but not necessarily scrub. 

If the cold is hard, start hot, alternate to cold when washing your hair, then back to warm before your toes fall off. But, ONLY cold water in your hair. Any amount of hot water can result in greasy hair at the end of your shower. 

Good luck, learn to love the cold. Cold showers are one of the best things I've found for energy, mental health, and immune system promotion.

Best,

- Juice from 1 lemon

How are you doing today?

So, I got some skin and hair problems ever since I can remember. When I was younger I didn't really care about hygien and it turns out that I grew up with a lot of pimples, blackheads and dandruff. 
This year when I decided to cut my long hair I realized that I was balding, and this process improved really fast through this year, it's terrifying. 
As you all probably know, commercial anti dandruff shampoos and skin care medicine didn't work at all. I went to the dermatologist and she said that I'm balding thanks to a condition called ""Dermatitis Seborrheic"", in other words my glands works too much, my body gets too oily and due to the lack of proper skin care it turns to be a really big problem. After researching I realised that it wasn't worth to take any of the tons medicine she asked me to buy and take - first because it's too expensive; second because they wouldn't solve the problem, just addict me (like anything in health industry nowadays). 
I decided to start taking cold showers and I am already used to it. I don't use any shampoos, but use conventional soaps to wash my body and head. After taking a shower, I apply apple cider vinegar and a tea of nettle, rosemary and cinnamon on my scalp and leave it. It works pretty good, my scalp isn't itching too much and no dandruff, but if I don't take a bath everyday the dandruff comes again and start itching a bit, but it isn't as bad as it used to be. 
I am trying a new diet, cutting the junk food as much as I can and taking vitamins and care more about nutrition. I also stated working out. 
PS: I'm just 18, that's why I am terrified.

The brush may flatten the cowlick, but the ends of my hair will stay wavy, creating an equally weird texture that I end up wanting to pin back; again, why bother trying if I’m just going to cover it up?

When I was a naive youth, I used to wash and blow dry my hair EVERY SINGLE DAY for this reason. It has always been a challenge to make my hair look nice from day to day, and I’m tired of constantly cutting it short. I miss having a bob/longer hair, so I’m growing it out again with the hope that I will be able to treat it better this time around and keep it nice looking, and also that I’ll at least be able to pull it into a bun on days when I don’t have time to fuss with it. Still, I just wanna be pretty some days! 

So, now that I have some length again...does anyone with a similar hair type have any suggestions for everyday styling for fine curls when daily rinsing is not an option? 

I want to note here that I try to use minimal product to as to keep from having to wash more often. My fine texture can easily look greasy. ",NoPoo

I then rinsed thoroughly and then soaked with ACV and then rinsed again.

I assume we don't have hard water because we have a whole house water softener but have never tested our water.  

My hair is thin and was 2C/3A with my old ways but has been much more straight since giving up conventional shampoo. (The exact opposite of what I had hoped for.)  

My current routine:  I wash with my shampoo bar, currently using ""Simply Shea"" by Apple Valley, and follow up with an ACV &amp; water rinse.  I've also started using about a dime size amount of conditioner in the ends of my hair along with an even smaller amount or Argan and Jojoba oils. On wash day my hair can have a lot of fly-aways and may even look frizzy.   Day 2 is hit or miss; sometimes my hair looks fine and other times my roots begin to look greasy.  By day 3 my roots are noticeably greasy.   Sometimes  I just braid it and deal, other times I use a homemade dry shampoo (corn starch and cocoa).   By day 4 I really struggle with whether to shampoo again or not. Sometimes the dry shampoo will get me 2 extra days, sometimes only 1 day.  I do notice that I can go a bit longer before my roots get greasy if I skip the ACV rinse.  I do have 2 boar bristle brushes that I've tried using.  It doesn't seem to make a huge difference and I'm not sure the oils are getting to the ends of my hair?  It's also been pretty rough on my curls.

I tried going water only but getting my hair wet seems to make it angry.  Even with lukewarm/cool-ish water it makes my roots immediately look more oily.

I do have Castile soap, if maybe some of that diluted with water would work, but I don’t have anything to condition after.

Looking for help and completely sick of my hair becoming greasy halfway through one day. Now I have been Water Only for two weeks running with no real need to use cleansing products at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

To preface, my hair is fine with a slight wave, and there is a LOT of it. I shed like crazy and currently it sits roughly at the bottom of my rib cage.

I always had heaps of trouble with my hair, in high school it was greasy on top with dry and splitting ends. If I washed it in the morning it would 100% be greasy by lunch time. It was infuriating for me. After some time complaining about it, my sisters friend said if I didn't wash it for 3 weeks and then went back to washing it normally it would be HEAPS easier. I thought this was great - in theory. Obviously I knew nothing about sulfates and silicones so it didn't make any difference, just that it was insanely oily for the three week duration.

So I went back to normal for some time, just washing it and dealing with the greasy and oiliness that went along with it. Until one day in my 20's I discovered reddit and this sub. I was so surprised it was an actual thing for people, let alone a possibility for me to maybe get to a point where I wouldn't need to wash my hair so much, which seemed completely unfathomable.

Anyway, I did some research and lurking of this subreddit and of course my first go to was baking soda and vinegar, which absolutely no idea about pH levels I just went ahead and did it. My hair texture changed, it became really thin and straight, it looked great for a while, until the baking soda started burning my scalp. Naturally I flipped and made my way back here for other alternatives, I came across rye flour.

Let me just say, Rye Flour is amaaaaaaazing. So good for you like, once a week, great protein for your hair. But I think I just found for me, it was unsustainable considering the length of my hair. But by this point, sticking to rye flour and especially no longer touching silicone conditioners, the length of time to washing my hair was increasing, bit by bit.

I was really happy, my hair was growing so well and it was great, it honestly still is but as I said, the upkeep with rye flour, the husk and potential damage to my plumbing was concerning for me. So after a few months, I looked to sulfate and silicone free shampoos and conditioners.

In my country, it's not so easily accessible and when you do find it, it is EXPENSIVE. I first tried [this](https://moogoo.com.au/milk-shampoo.html) along with the matching conditioner, it worked well and my hair grew like crazy. After a while though my scalp was getting really dry. I had started to learn a bit more about ingredients in shampoo and conditioner and realised it is full of coconut derivatives, which I don't think my skin agrees very well with. So again, I looked for another alternative.

I then found [this shampoo](https://www.akin.com.au/sensitive--scalp/p/mild-and-gentle-fragrance-free-shampoo-225ml/1310001.html?lang=en_AU#lang=en_AU&amp;start=1). Which is pretty much what I have been using for the past year. It has been so great, even though it's expensive for me, I only use it roughly once a week. It doesn't foam up much, but you don't necessarily need it to. Because of my dry ends, the conditioner was perhaps not enough to help with the splitting, but I changed to the deep conditioner, which easily fixed the issue. Also conditioner only with this product worked really well to my surprise.

Anyway, recently I have been between my two jobs, I start a new one soon. But I got really lazy and didn't wash my hair with anything but water. It's been two weeks and it actually looks really good. The only thing I've recently changed is my hairbrush to one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Brush-Cushion-Bristle-Handle-Brushes/dp/B00898E5O2) which has helped immensely with my split ends.

Anyway, if you're curious to know what gross disgusting foul greasy after half a day hair looks like after literal years of trial and error, to today with two weeks WO, here it is. Remember kids, persistence is key.

I decided on a whim to cut my hair into a pixie cut in 2014, and was recommended to go without shampoo by my hairdresser. I listened, and now my hair is so much healthier! I started by just using conditioner a couple days a week, and after a few months my scalp didn't feel so oily. I then used an ACV based hair rinse by DP Hue and I loved it. But now, I am water-only 95% of the time. Maybe conditioner once a month.

4531,t3_9rlxr3,"I have thin hair. My usual routine is to shampoo my hair every other day, and cover it with dry shampoo on days when I don't wash my hair. I recently started using lush bars, which I loved, but then realized they have sulfates, and now I am not sure I want to use them. I also have a giant bottle of livingproof shampoo, which I like. I also normally use a detangler, volumizing spray, heat protector, sometimes I use hair wax, and finish it off with hair spray.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a large forehead, so it is not easy for me to wear my hair up, because my forehead looks giant! Same goes for headbands, etc. I work out a lot, so I don't want to bother with bangs. When I had bangs, I had to wash it every day, and it was thinning out even more, so I gave up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I washed my hair normally as described above on Monday. Then I wanted to go swimming on Wednesday evening, so I didn't want to wash my hair on Wednesday morning, as I would normally do, and instead I just wore it up. It is not normal for me, and I didn't feel good the whole day. 

&amp;#x200B;

On Wednesday night I ended up not going swimming, and instead was reading about this subreddit and checking out some FAQs.I didn't want to have a weird transitioning period, since I am already very concerned about my face and my hair, and having greasy hair is not something I am ok putting up with. 

I already have a boar-bristle brush, so I was wondering, what would happen if I just wash my hair with warm water only, and condition. I was like.. well.. the worst thing that can happen, I will have to wash it again the next day, but it's worth a try. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I washed my hair thoroughly, massaging very well, then applied a tiny bit of conditioner, and made sure I rinse it well. To my surprise, my hair felt very clean, I didn't feel the difference comparing to using shampoo. And if you don't feel the difference, then why use it? I was shocked with the results. I noticed my hair was more shiny, but not oily. I also skipped the detangler (surprisingly my hair didn't feel like straw, so I didn't see the need), skipped the volumizing spray, and everything else. I just dried my hair with a hairdryer, and it felt really good all day. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the evening I swapped my silk pillowcase around to make sure it is clean, and combed my hair with the boar-bristle brush. I went to sleep without braiding my hair (hoping for that magical effect of a silk pillowcase). I brushed my hair thoroughly with the brush, and went to work. This is the first time I went to work with my second-day hair free of any products. I can definitely see reduced volume compared to yesterday, and I am definitely slightly concerned that by the end of the day my hair is going to look oily, but I am hoping for the best. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I just want to share, and if you guys have any tips or comments, feel free.

I learned these are cyclic silicones (or siloxanes) based on a [Naturally Curly article](https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/curlchemist-cyclomethicones-a-different-category-of-silicones) which also includes some mixed messages about build-up, e.g., ""Cyclomethicones... aren't prone to build-up"" and ""[consumer-reported] problems were attributed to build-up on the surface or build-up due to penetration of the smaller silicone into the hair shaft,"" then the author suggests the unfavorable results were due to a different mechanism.  

[Neonatural.com](http://www.nenonatural.com/hair-blog/-water-soluble-vs-non-soluble-silicones-found-in-hair-products) indicates Cyclohexasiloxane is only slightly soluble and Cyclopentasiloxane is not water soluble, indicating these are both likely to contribute to buildup.

All I can really tell you about my hair is that it's fine, low porosity and has henna in it now.

Can I go back to using Dr Bronners without drying out my hair? I found the liquid soaps more drying than the bar soap, which I didn't expect. Is Dr bronners damaging at all? I'd hate to jump in only to find a few months down the track that I've wrecked my hair. I'm not keen on doing baking soda for this reason.

Can anyone make some suggestions for me? Cheers :) ",NoPoo

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very new to the whole ""no 'poo"" thing (a bit over a week in), so I'm still on my first method which is applying a mask of bentonite clay, ACV, lavender essential oil, and water (enough to form a paste), every three days or so, rinsing with a diluted ACV rinse, and brushing with a BBB the days between.  

&amp;#x200B;

The bentonite clay honestly almost seems too good to be true - it leaves my hair soft, de-tangled, and not overly greasy.  Has anyone else been doing this long term?

4580,t3_9jtl89,"I've been washing with water only for about 2 years. I heard about No Poo and without really doing any research just decided to stop using shampoo, conditioner or styling products in my hair. I do pretty much nothing to it except rinse it with hot water and towel dry it into a rough messy style. I've always kept my hair pretty short and this process has served me well. However, I've grown it a bit longer now (apparently having newborn twins doesn't leave much time for things like haircuts), and instead of just lopping most of it off, I want an actual hairstyle. If you Google ""male haircut short sides long top"", pretty much any of the image results are what I'd be aiming for.

My problem is that when my hair is a bit longer, it gets kind of fluffy, voluminous and difficult to control. It doesn't *feel* too dry, but it kind of looks it, I guess. I think my individual hairs are quite fine and wiry, I just have a lot of them, if that makes sense. My hair's not curly, but once it gets a bit longer it's also definitely not straight by any measure.

What can I do to tame it into my desired style? I've loved the feeling of not having any wax or gel in my hair and am reluctant to go back to using some kind of styling product, although I'm open to recommendations if that's the way I have to go.

I had been attempting NoPoo for several years with mixed results in the quality of my hair. I'm also quite active and regularly workout and also work in a hospital and am likely colonized by MRSA. 

During this time I developed a true chronic folliculitis in my beard (NOT (pseudo)follicitis barbae). For years I took intermittent and then suppressive doxycycline with some suppression of the follicitis, but never a remission. Retrospectively the time correlation between NoPoo and development of the folliculitis seems pretty clear, but at the time I couldn't attribute a clear cause. I do have a history of acne (requiring accutane) and changing my pillow cases daily seemed a bit helpful but was unsustainable. Ultimately I tried daily shampooing with strong salisylic acid shampoo and have been folliculitis free for months for the first time in YEARS. 

Let this be a cautionary tale that if you are prone to development of comedones (acne) and are likely colonized with MRSA via healthcare work or high-level physical activity/gym going, then NoPoo may result in chronic skin issues.

I tried the distilled water and acv today and WOW my scalp feels great, my hair isn’t greasy, and it has volume! Worlds a difference from the greaseball lumpy tangly mess I had when I tried shampoo bars before.

I did more research and found out that hard water leaves build up in your hair which can make your hair feel disgusting. It also doesn’t rinse out. It basically adds chlorine and a load of other crud to you hair. Plus it can cause dandruff, itchy scalp, and eczema. So I’m investing in a $30 water softener shower filter.

Look on YouTube on how to test if you have hard or soft water. This can be done with castille soap/dr bronners and a cup of your shower water. I’m sure there are other methods.

I've started using micellar water from Garnier occasionally on my face and reading a post from a few months ago I thought I'd see what happened if I used it on my hair.  I used the same amount as I normally use for my clay shampoo, about 1/3 c. and scrubbed it into my scalp.  Immediately I could tell that it was cleaning it really well, perhaps too well.  The water started to get kind of milky colored as it grabbed all the sebum.  I then rinsed it all out and used my normal conditioner so the only thing that changed in my routine was the cleanser.

Results: Not a huge fan. My hair got really tangled after using it and felt way too squeaky clean, this was almost like a sulfate wash.  I would only use this vary rarely as a clarifier.  If however you have a different style hair maybe this would work, or perhaps it could be diluted to give better results.

I’m open to any suggestions that anyone has about the above but, my biggest problem by far is that my hair is rather fine and when I wash it and run my fingers through my hair while washing, no matter how careful or gentle I am, I have noticed a lot of recent breakage. It’s the thing that has me most tempted to go back to shampoo and conditioner (not that I want to) because using conditioner I never had so much breakage. ",NoPoo
4626,t3_9do1ms,"Heyyo. So my hair.. more so scalp is getting so dry and flakey and ITCHY omg  its moving onto my face! 
Bit of back ground. 
Ive got long thick greek hair. It take about 3 weeks to show signs of oiliness. 
-only ever washed my hair about once a week to 1.5 week. 
-went through a no poo month or two recently using ACV and have used bi carb as a wash 3 times in that period. 
Everything was cool. Hair lovely, scalp clean.

Then the horror.
Noticing my hair getting dryer  and some dandruff i started using a tea tree shampoo and coco conditioner from 'biologika'
Seemed like it didnt work...
The dryness then started creeping to my face. Thinking maybe it was an allergic reaction so for the last 2.5 weeks ive used nothing. 
No mousteriser,
No cleansers on my face and i havent even washed my hair.  No improvment.  Argh im gross!

So i went to the dr. And he suggested to use Tgel theorputic shampoo....Buuuut it had SLS in it. I dont want to use this.. im supposed to use it 3 times a week. I fear SLS will dry my scalp more and also the damage to aquatic life that SLS does is a big no no. 

I heard moo goo scalp cream is good. I bought that yesterday.. buuut i dont know if it will work.

At the start of my dry face scalp fiasco i used some goat mousteriser and while it helped the day of applications i always woke up with it worse.

Any suggestions guys? 

Oh and previously my skin was very tollerable.  It wasnt too dry or too oily. And i never wear make up excpet maybe like once every 6 months or so.

I've not been able to try out NoPoo as consistently as I would like to. I spent much of the last 3 years with bleached blonde hair. Naturally, my hair is a mid brown, so you can imagine the state it was in. 
About 2 months ago, I decided to stop bleaching, and had my hair dresser put a brown on to cover most of the blonde. I'm planning to not dye or bleach - hopefully never again!
My hair is quite thick, and prone to breakage. My hairdresser told me that moisture is actually the worst thing for bleached hair! Bleach strips the protein out of hair, and adding moisture makes it very weak.
I discovered the power of the natural hair mask today. I mixed up an egg, coconut oil, honey, and a little cocoa powder (to help fight the fade!). I slathered it on, and left it overnight. I've washed it out with a low-poo (no Parabens or SLS). My hair is still drying - but my god it's beautiful.
I've also learned that I should not be using baking soda on my hair right now, because it's pretty good at ripping the dye out!
I hope my little experiment can be helpful to someone.

I'm looking to start my cowashing journey.  I have super fine and thin straight hair.  I've recently had some pretty bad breakage from bleaching, so I'm doing a drastic 180 and putting natural haircare at the top of my list.  I've trimmed off what I can of the breakage and am not going to bleach again.  From what I've read at /r/FancyFollicles basically my only option is to cut off the dead and wait for it to grow out. 

&amp;#x200B;

With so much information out there, I've found a ton of different techniques and conditioners to use.  Right now I'm using Suave Essentials (in a strawberry sent).  I thought that was a safe option but from my research it seems they've changed the ingredients and only the coconut ""flavor"" is the co-wash/no poo approved variety.  **Can I use the rest of this bottle? Or am I better off just going and getting a new bottle?**

&amp;#x200B;

I've read a ton about how you wash on wash day.  What no one really covers is **What does the week look like? Do you cowash everyday? Every 3-4 days?  Do you apply leave in conditioners? If so, do you do that everyday? How does that look?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Most importantly, I work out a lot-- and because of my thin/fine hair sweat basically saturates my entire head.  Due to my breakage I've been just allowing my hair to air dry after exercise (because I've sworn off any hot tools unless I'm going to a formal event or something).  **Will this method work when cowashing? How do I approach sweaty gym hair?** Do I let it dry and then try to comb through any oils? 

Finally, Do you do any additional oils in your hair, maybe at night between washes? **Show me your typical routine for cowashing!**

So last November I decided to finally make the jump and go no-poo. It was something I had been interested in trying for a couple of years but never had the courage to actually do. Here is my story (yea I know I wrote a novel) and my experience, and I hope it helps give a little hope to people just starting out who are struggling.

Starting out, my transition to no-poo was born out of circumstance more than anything. Last fall I made the decision to set up a camp out in the woods on the edge of town and make it my home. I had a rudimentary shower rig but washing up still only happened a couple times a week at most, so I used a BBB in between ""showers"" to try and tame the grease. 

After a month or so had passed and winter was getting close, I decided it was time to return to society so I got an apartment. I decided that even though I was easily able to shower every day, I wanted to keep going down the no-poo road. I researched a little more about Water-Only routines and developed one for myself. 

Every day before I showered and before I went to bed I would scritch my hair really thoroughly and go through it with my BBB. In the shower, I would scritch again while making sure the water was hitting my scalp directly where I was scritching, and move my hair around to help the water rinse out all the dirt and oil. For drying I would simply dab my hair with my towel to get some of the water out and then let it do it's thing. 

It took about 3 months for me to go through the ""transition"" phase until I no longer looked like Kurt Cobain, and now my hair is the healthiest and best-looking it has ever been. It is soo soft and shiny now, and the color even slightly changed! I have always had dirty blonde hair, but before going WO it was more light brown. Now it is waay more blonde and people have noticed. Starting out was pretty tough and I had plenty of moments where I was ready to give up, but now I wouldn't even dream of putting ANYTHING in my hair besides water. 

If you're just starting out and are stuck in the horribly waxy transition, keep going you can do it! The pay-off is definitely definitely worth it. ",NoPoo

Does anyone have any experience with nopoo and seborrheic dermatitis?

4680,t3_97fqt0,"Hey.

I've been using castile soap for over a year, nothing else. The first 8-9 months were great (apart from transition hell). But I'm not happy with it any more as my hair feels increasingly dry. It's also always been greasy and I still have to wash it every day. For a while I could do every other day, but it's back to daily again. I'm not sure what's going on.

I have extremely thin and 'dead' hair. It looks a lot better since ditching shampoo so I won't go back. I just need to change things up.

What would be a good direction to go in? I worry co washing will make my hair look greasy and flat (I avoided conditioner previously as it made my hair that much more flat and lifeless - don't know if it would be any different now?). I'm off put by the baking powder and ACV stuff as I tried it before and it just seems cumbersome and ineffective. I don't mind making my own concoction, but only if I can make a bottle and not need too much effort every day, like cracking open an egg or whatever. If I only had to wash my hair once a week it would be another story. But I need to be able to wash it quickly without too much hassle every day.

My goal is to have healthier hair and be able to wash it less. I'll settle for healthier though. It's getting irritatingly dry!

I read years ago that the straighter and longer your hair is, the harder it is to ditch shampoo. So I'm happy I've managed to at all. But I would *love* to not have it get greasy every day and to wash it less often. I can try another 'transition' period, I just don't trust I'll get results. I'm not sure what to try.

Any suggestions or advice? 

Thank you.

The bangs/around my scalp is where the greasiness is really noticeable (*especially* the bangs, though).

There are several different factors that could be causing the acne but I'm afraid that one of them is the fact that I've recently attempted the No Poo/Low Poo method again. so I guess I just wanted to know if there's any advice out there on the transition period of no poo and face acne. last time I tried no poo I did get acne on my scalp but this time since I am still using a low poo once or twice a week I haven't been suffering from that but my hair is still greasy/waxy most of the time so I'm afraid that it's transferring to my face and causing the acne. Is there any way to avoid this? My hair is already up most of the time but that doesn't seem to be making a difference. I don't want to shampoo more often just to avoid the acne if I did that I might as well go back to regular Poo but I really don't know if I can suffer through this my entire transition. Especially considering I'm still messing around with what works for my hair.,NoPoo

4730,t3_92h3vy,"Hey guys! I just started on the no poo method - literally last week - and as you might imagine I am in the dreadful transition period. I am enduring with oily hair by keeping it up or braiding it, and I’m honestly fine with it; HOWEVER my judgemental family is criticizing me like crazy, saying that it’s disgusting, that I look dirty and all kind of happy and support reassuring words that I need (not lol). I didn’t even let they know what I’m doing because I know they will say that’s disgusting and won’t accept it because they are so close minded. I tried explaining that by washing my hair less frequently will make it healthy and that it won’t look this oily next week or so, that there are plenty of people who do the same and a lot of info online but they just won’t listen to me. Did any of you went through criticism while doing the no poo method? How did you deal with it?

I'm having some doubts about this No poo.. well. no.. having doubts about No conditior and need some help.  


I've tried looking at the FAQ and pinned post stuff but on my desk top i can't see the community info.. it's only on my phone and it's really hard to see and go to all the links.  
my hair history.  
 i live in Australia, I have type 2ish hair. but it's super thick. super greek and below shoulder legnth.  
For my life I have only needed to wash my hair once a week or once a fortnight sometimes.  
my hair never gets oily, the only reason i'd actually wash is that after about a week it would get itchy and gunky.  
I am ( was) an avid user of products, due to my hair not being naturally oily i would use a lot of leave in conditioners and oils. it would jsut soak it up, but my hair wasn't ever really dry either except the ends... my hair is in "" good"" condition apart from having all these chemicals in it.  


 recently, I mistakenly have done two washes ( 1 each week) with bi carb prior to doing a last sulphate wash to get rid of the silicones. and used AVC.  the first week was amazing. my scalp never felt so clean, but by the second week my hair was getting very knotty and kinda... elastic? when i'd brush it would spring/stretch/pull and then break. it didn't feel.. like.. good.  
wash ratios i used  was 1 and half TBS bi carb and 2 Cup water.  
ACV 20ml to 320ml water  
last night i did a massive coconut oil left it in untill tonight where i have done my last sulphate wash.  
I rinsed with AVC ( i hope that is okay)  


I am mostly confused about the no conditioner part. I understand that ACV is supposed to replace that part?  
Also what is a replacement for a leave in conditioner? a lot of suggestions are oils.. but that makes my hair look oily?as each time i used oils for the past 2 weeks it made my hair more oily than it used to.   
the oils i used was coconut and teatree ( teatree on account of dandruft)  


am I to just trust that i wont need any conditioner or treatment after a shower eventually?also sometimes i straighten my hair, but i suppose i will have to give up a heat protectant? is there an alternative? will i need to do that anymore considering my hair ""should"" be getting healthier and stronger?  


okay, thats it i think. sorry guys.. and thank you.

[the comb in question ](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/schwarz-manufacturing-co-brass-comb) is made of brass, which is a big part of what makes it so cool but I was just wondering the other day if it has the potential to damage my hair more than a plastic or wooden comb.  My hair is really thick and it always has at least a knot or two which I have to use a bit of force to get through, and I'm a little bit worried the sharper metal teeth could do some harm if I force it through my hair.

Anyhow, over the weekend I had some time off, so I though I'd do a full hair treatment. Started off with one week greasy hair (this would be the time I usually wash it).

I first did a milk and honey mask. Melted three teaspoons of honey into a cup or two of full fat milk, soaked my towel dried hair with the mixture focusing on the ends. Let it sit for close on an hour, then rinsed it out with water only.

Had some castor oil laying around, and put some on the most damaged sections of my hair while still damp. Let it sit for a day.

Did a egg yolk mask/wash (as I will do anytime I really need to clean the hair like now due to the oil), and put a small amount of a Lush massage bar (mainly cocoa and shea butter) on the ends as a conditioner.

My hair is the softest and nicest it has been in such a long time! The shine is crazy, and not oily or waxy at all. I think my hair was just dying for some moisture.

Try this if your hair feels a bit dry and unmanageable. I will def incorporate milk and honey masks more frequently.

Sorry for the poor picture qualities :/

Hair description:

My hair is brown/reddish, thin, mid-long, and I usually dye it once a month with supermarket dye shampoos to cover some whites. 


Perspective:

I believe this is the ideal moment for me to transition, since I'm going on holiday (no stress about greasy hair in the office) and I'll spend my third transition week at the seaside (potentially a lot of sea water + normal water washes).


Questions:

1. About NoPoo products:

I don't want to use anything but water (and comb/brush). No rye flour, no baking soda, etc. Is this realistic? 


2. About washing or not washing:

I've already started by not washing my hair for 4 days (I usually wash it every other day or max every 3 days). Today it's greasy. Should I wash it with water already or waiting is better? 


3. About hair dye:

My hair always looked greasy at the top and dried out in the lengths. It didn't bother me that much because I usually put it up in a braid. But I also lose much more hair than before.

To give a bit of background, for the last year or so my scalp has been super oily. If I don’t wash my hair every other day (might have to switch to everyday soon!) it looks really gross. 

Did anyone have this issue and did nopooing help? What are the transition phases like as your hair adjusts? I’m starting a new job soon in a position that’s very people facing so I’m a bit worried about getting scolded for my hair (which my old job did!). 

Also, I see people mention using a boar thistle hair brush. Is there any particular one that you guys would recommend? 

Is there any particular website that anyone would recommend for beginners as well?

I wanted to document my no shampoo journey here. I have a mid-length bob, blond hair, kind of wavy and want to let it grow and to have curls 🙈 (my dream 😍). I did the transitioning from conventional shampoo to organic, without sulfate / silicone a few years back but never really attempted a real no shampoo apart from one time in holidays at the sea. 

My hair gets kind of greasy but at the same time it’s dry if I don’t wash it. some other times it’s limp and greasy, depending on hormons I guess. I washed it every 2 or 3 days with shampoo and I have really hard water. It best form is on the sea side were it gets crazy curly and I can stretch out the washing. It doesn’t get too much oily, but lot of volume and a bit dry (because of the sea salt that I just wash out with water).

Now my last wash with shampoo was 3 days ago. Today I washed my hair with one organic egg (yellow + white), I put some essential oils in it and rinced out with lots of water. I finished with AVC. My hair is really soft, bouncy and feels clean. No greasiness ! 

I hope you can see the photos ! Any question welcome and sorry for my english 😉.

Ever since I was a teenager whenever I washed my hair, From then on to the second day with just water, it would ALWAYS be waxy as hell.

I even tried no shampoo for a few months with only water and the wax built al the way down to my hair tips and would not go away, apple cider vinegar never did anything.

I ended up using shampoo but avoiding water on my second day since then.
But it was still crap and would be oily within hours of washing and just get worse and not stop.

So recently I’ve been trying to look up better methods for getting rid of oily hair because I started wetting my hair on the second day again and it looks terrible like it always did and is hella waxy at the top of the head.

I’ve only been washing my hair with this https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/325785/organic-care-kids-hair-care-3-in-1-fruit-blast every second day and not touching my hair roots or scalp with anything, because the so-called natural shampoo bars have more dangerous ingredients than normal shampoo, I just don’t touch the roots or scalp, but I got skin flaking off even though I scrub my scalp with water in the shower.

My hair is always crap when I wet it without washing it.

This is my first post here and I didn't knew that this community existed in reddit. I heard about no poo when I googled my questions out of curiosity about not using shampoo. 

I have been on it for 40 days. There was dandruff and all in the beginning but everything was fine. 

One problem I had was that my hair gets all tangled up like messy and all if I don't use oil. I usually use coconut hair oil.  Like I can't comb my hair unless I use oil. I wanted to know if this is something I should be concerned about. 

I would love to hear your thoughts on this. ",NoPoo
4807,t3_8t3w5g,"Hi all, I'm 21 year old male hair with medium length, wavy/curly brown hair (not quite at my shoulders).

I tried NoPoo a month ago as I got tired of the following routine: Day 1 - I shampoo and my hair looks frizzy and brittle, Day 2 - it looks nice but slightly greasy Day 3 - looks greasy and need to shampoo 

So I quit shampoo and have been water only since I wanted something completely low maintenance. However, I am now finding that using shampoo was less maintenance than this. My hair constantly feels stuck on my head, it looks bad unless I use dry shampoo. I have to brush it to bring down the oils (never used to brush my hair) but it feels like the oils stay up there. 

I'm close to giving in the towel, as I don't like this feeling. I know there is an awkward stage to get past, but brushing my hair and constantly massaging my hair  is more effort than using shampoo!

Is there something that I could use that is good for wavy hair to keep it ungreasy? I don't really care about the shampoo toxicity stuff, and I'm willing to use it maybe once a week if I have to. Any advice on how to get into a routine for this?",NoPoo
4808,t3_8sy37t,"So as I'm now almost 2 months in NoPoo, I've done my share of experimenting with NoPoo options. Egg yolk wash works the best, but I can't do it every time because of protein build up. After doing some homework, I found that it's the emulsifier aspect of the yolk that washes hair so well : it binds to the excess hair oils and washes right out. So going further down the rabbit hole, I read that soy lecithin is an emulsifier with very little protein. PERFECT. Or so I thought. I started washing my hair with it, scrubbing the granules to my scalp and my hair was nooooot feeling it. In fact, the more I scrubbed, the more it started to dreadlock. For reference, I have medium thickness, straight, shoulder length hair. IT HAS NO BUSINESS DREADLOCKING. It's like the strands started clupming together and they're also sticky??? The best way I could describe it is like if you downed an entire bottle of hair spray in your hair and dumped your head under a faucet for a second - that clumpy, sticky hair feeling. Guys, I don't know how to wash it out. I tried undiluted castille soap and even an anti-residue shampoo I had leftover from my shampoo days. Hardly anything. I cracked two eggs and washed with the egg yolk as well.. all of those things maaaaaybe made it like, 1/5 better. Rubbing alcohol didn't work, and neither did reguar hair oil.

4810,t3_8svwuj,"Hello reddit. I've so far loved my NoPoo experience. I embarked on my 6 month long journey last November, and have kept a simple routine for about 4 months without any interruptions or mishaps. 
I am a dude, and lately I've been sporting a mild, faded undercut with an ever-growing 5 inch top. I don't use any store-bought hair gels, pomades, products etc. A few months back I used to put a little coconut oil in my hair though it left very grotesque and offensive smell within a day or so of applying it. It gave my hair a little more hold though it did not drastically improve anything, so I decided to go with out it. Overall, going NoPoo has given my hair some more hold, meaning that it has been easier to style it and push it up and away from my face without any products. The natural oils and sebum really serve as their own kind of gel or product. However, despite this natural improvement, I'm left wanting something a little better.

I recently went to barbershop for a trim and decided to allow my barber to put a little bit of product in my hair. I must admit, that despite NoPoo making my hair look more natural and healthy, certain products give me a look that I cannot achieve naturally. The barber put some sort of ""tonic"" and fiber gel into my hair, and I really like the way it holds. I don't apply any synthetic products on a daily basis, and I don't think that I ever will, though to see that my hair can look so cool when styled-up with manly (think '60s rockstar) products is certainly refreshing. 
After this ordeal, I decided to wash my hair with a sulfate-containing shampoo for the first time in 4 months (note: I had been strictly water-only during that 4 month period as well), in order to get rid of any build up I had accumulated from the products the barber put in my hair, over time etc. I must admit that it left my hair feeling extremely clean, despite it stripping my hair of its natural oils. However, washing with this shampoo left my hair lifeless and lacking in volume (fell flat on my forehead). The gentlest of winds blew my quiff into a stupid-looking fringe. I decided that I needed to find a natural product that would help me keep my hair off of my face whilst enriching it naturally. I remembered reading about flaxseed hair gels a while back, though I only found it mentioned in strictly curly hair forums, African/frizzy hair oriented forums etc. I wondered if it would work on relatively straight hair, if it could act as a natural styling agent such as more traditional, synthetic hair products for men (flaxseed gel is directed at curly-haired women). I went to the store and bought a bag of flaxseeds, followed a simple recipe I found online, and made my own batch of the gel. I applied it to my hair while damp, and blowdried it for a few minutes. While I found that the hold wasn't as strong as I had hoped, it really does its job well at keeping my hair off of my face. I would consider a light-hold product. Longevity and the nutritional value of this product can be enhanced by adding honey or any of the well known natural oils often discussed on this sub.

*It should be noted that I used this product after washing my hair with sulfate shampoo, thus ridding my hair of it's natural oils. I hope that once my hair returns to equilibrium, which I suspect will happen in about 4-5 days, that the flaxseed gel will work together with my hair's natural oils in order to produce a stronger hold. Thank you for reading and I apologize for the wall of text. 

Verdict: In my experience, flaxseed gel, which is often directed at frizzy or curly haired women, works on shorter and straighter hair, acting as a light-hold product sufficient to keep hair off of one's forehead and or face

This morning they looked alright, oil gives them that wet look tho. I had my friend over for a late lunch and he said nothing about my hair.

* Improved mood, energy, and alertness.
* Muscle weakness gone and improved grip.
* Stopped feeling cold all the time.
* No longer sore/stiff after physical labor, such as mowing lawn.
* No more mucus when spitting.
* Less brittle, more manageable hair.

I had made no other changes.  After about a week, the gains seemed less dramatic, but still there.  Perhaps there was a detox period and things had leveled off, I thought.

Ingredients:
-1 1/2 cup distilled water
-2 Tbsp white sugar
-1 Tbsp vodka or other high-proof vodka (apparently spiced rum gives this a very nice smell) - preservative

Directions:
1. Boil water.  Add sugar and stir to dissolve.
2. Cool to room temperature, transfer to a spray bottle and add alcohol.  Shake to combine.
3. Store at room temperature.

2. Cool to room temperature, transfer to a spray bottle. Store at room temperature.

Note: this one didn’t have any mention of shelf-life. I suspect it’s why you make less at a time. If you use this, smell it occasionally. It may go off over a week or three.

Mix 1-2 Tbsp Low poo conditioner to 1 cup water in a spray bottle. Shake well.  Spray on wet hair and comb through starting at he ends and making your way up slowly after each comb-through.

Adjust your ratios if you need to. If you have very fine hair, use a lot less conditioner. It will weigh your hair down and make it look greasy if you use too much. Also, different conditioners will give you different results. Shea Moisture Weightless conditioner will be much lighter than a coconut oil or castor oil based conditioner. ",NoPoo

4860,t3_8lb4ac,"So I let one of my kombucha cultures grow without tending to it and it gave me a hefty-ass 1 inch thick kombucha SCOBY. Has anyone ever tried blending a kombucha SCOBY and making it a thick smoothie type paste to rub in their hair? I've heard of using the kombucha vinegar as a rinse (obvs being acidic, as a substitute for apple cider vinegar or lemon juice), so my logic is why not the SCOBY itself, right? Maybe even add some essential oils to it / blended herbs and stick it in a glass jar in the fridge and take out as much as needed for a shampooing. 
My only reservation is that it's the bacterial / fungal culture itself instead of the vinegar, so I'm wondering if it will mess up hair's bacterial balance.
Am I going too far down the rabbit hole with this? 

Anyways, will experiment and update. If my hair falls out, well.. now we know. 

OK, UPDATE!:
So I cut off a 2x2 piece of SCOBY and blended it with some filtered water. Thanks to Je4Fy, I had the good sense to cut quarter sized pieces with some scissors instead of putting the whole chunk in there and burning my blender motor. I have a good enough blender that it blended into a thicker applesauce-type texture, which is what I wanted. I added a couple drops of Cedarwood and Rosemary essential oils for flavor, but that's not anything new added to my hair. 

The wash went fairly well. I had about 1/3 of a cup of SCOBY which I scrubbed into my hair and left for about 10 min. I rinsed for 2-3 min. 

Upon checking my hair in the mirror, I saw little flakes that you would see when doing a rye flour wash. By this point my hair was half dry and I didn't want to wet it again, so I figured I'd let it dry and then snow-flurry the flakes out (gross, I know, but whatevs). 

Well, it wasn't as easy to snow-flurry as the SCOBY doesn't get dry like rye flour, it's naturally rubbery so it was a pain to get out. It's the next day and I'm still finding small flakes but I'd say it's 95% out. And I have straight, short hair that's not even that thick! I would nooot recommend it for curly or long hair. My naturally soft oily hair also felt dryer and coarser as it was drying, but normalized once dry. 

In closing, I'm not sure I would do it again. The only positive that I can MAYBE see is that I swear my hair grew a little overnight. But then again, I'm using EO and Biotin to stimulate hair growth, sooo.. the jury's still out on that one. But it also seems coincidental. hmmph. 
Also, my scalp feels slightly tingly/itchy here and there (like if you didn't rinse out your apple cider vinegar well enough), but I don't know if that's just my paranoia that I washed my hair with a living bacterial and fungal paste. 

TL;DR: Yeah.. I honestly don't think I'd try it again. The SCOBY is just too much of a pain to wash out and I didn't care for the coarser texture while it was drying. Anyways, it was worth the experiment!",NoPoo

First of all, sorry if my english seems weird : I'm french, trying my best :p
So I recently started the Nopoo thing 2 weeks ago. I never had that period where my hair went super greasy though but I spent a lot of time in my shower malaxing my scalp under hot water. I feel my scalp is getting better, I had some psoriasis in the back of my head and was very itchy. I don't have that anymore at least, less than before.
But I have some issues now, my face and my body went itchy like 3 or 4 days ago, i dunno why but this is real bad, i get read just for scrathing it. I was wondering if I'm attracting some weirds insects and never had that the first days of Nopoo.
I'm under treatment for acnee and using some ""Hyfac"" products (cleansing gel, global care for the day and ""Epiduogel"" for the night) but never had that issues when I started the treatment a month ago.
Also, I red it wasn't too good to stay too much under hot water for dandruff issues, I had some before Nopoo but not that much now. Should I try mid temperatured water ?
And I can't decide myself if still go full Nopoo or do I buy some conditioner and shampoo adapted for me, I have to go to the haircut and fear that so much to ruin all my efforts...

4894,t3_8eu50a,"Thanks for any insight on this. I just cleaned my BBB for the first time (had it for about a month, been using it on day 2 and 3 after washing) and there was a lot of white filminess on the bristles, and the hairs that I pulled out felt filmy and gross as well. Is it normal for the brush to collect grossness, or can I expect it to lessen over time? Or is it a sign that I should change my routine, even though I thought it was working well for my hair?

It's weird because my scalp hasn't been flaky, and my hair does start to feel dirty by day 3 after washing, but it is never as gross as this brush felt before cleaning it.

(My routine: The last time I used shampoo was 2/28/18 and since then I've been washing with diluted Dr. Bronner's followed by a diluted ACV rinse and cool water. 2 days between washes for the month of March, and since 4/1 I've been going for 3 days between washes.

My home water is extremely hard, you can even smell the chlorine in it when you run the shower. So I tried a chelating shampoo (kenra clarifying), thinking maybe my issues were caused by buildup.

4908,t3_8c4nzr,"My best friend has been trying to get me to go no-poo for years now. It has never worked for me. Until now.

About my hair: Naturally dirty blonde, about 20-30% gray, frequently highlighted (as in every 6 weeks-two months; very fine hair, but not necessarily thin, has a lot of volume when blown dry straight; waves/ curls a bit (2b-c depending on length) yet without any rhyme or reason.  Hair currently is about an inch or two below my chin (i.e., not quite long enough to put into a neat sleek pony tail). I haven't worn my hair this long in ages because it typically breaks off before it gets past my shoulders, and just looks ratty. And when it's that long and I put it in a hairband, it's just so fine, well, we call it ""the nubbin."" And I have to tie the hairband so tight since it'll just slip off, it results in breakage. My hair prefers the dreaded clippy, but this is 2018. :-(

My ends typically always look dry and destroyed. But oils just don't work either. Over the years I've tried it all - jojoba, morrocan, coconut oil, olive oil.. before, during after shower, and overnight with a cap on. It just sits on my hair making it look like a super shiny grease pit, and doesn't seem to absorb. Though does soften my hair -- once I shampoo it out.

Also - a big ALSO - I have had scalp psoriasis since I was a child. It can get really bad, as in covering my entire scalp. This isn't dandruff either. Big flakes, lots of itch. Prescription shampoo (Clobetasal) works great to control it, but if I've run out then I am abusing my hair with all kinds of harsh tar shampoos. 

I am really careful to avoid chlorine or salt water or too much sun, as all of that can result in straw hair for me. Yet my hair plumps up and/or frizzes in high humidity. Which sometimes can make it look great, I just can't predict. 

Best friend aforementioned has gorgeous thick straight long hair, which she washes only once a week, and looks perfect regardless of the weather. She insists it's as fine and thick as mine, but I just don't see it.

So I have tried this no-poo thing numerous times over the years, yearning for same healthy head of hair, with zero success. Even if I could endure the grease of day 2 / 3 hair, I couldn't endure the psoriasis flare up which was unbearable. 

Then I got a new hairdresser who recommended a new shampoo and conditioner, which is sulfate, paraben, and silicone free. I have been using it daily for 6 months.  Alternating with the prescription shampoo every now and then... and then less and less. Because my scalp has totally cleared up! It's never felt better!!!!

Two weeks ago I decided to give no-poo one last try. My girlfriend is visiting me at the end of this month so I figured I could maybe try until then. 

Week one I was able to go 6 days without washing!!!!! I am amazed. I've never been able to go that long. (Note I did one last wash with the Rx shampoo, no conditioner. Then I did a WO wash a few times the first week, and co-washed when needed for de-tangling. Then on the last day tried curly girl method -- using olive oil-- and it was a disaster so I shampooed). 

This week, I am on day 6 again and I think I can push it at least one more day, as I invested in a BBB brush which does seem to be helping. I still seemed to need to WO wash it twice this week, and I put on just a little (like a teaspoon) worth of conditioner on the ends to de-tangle in the shower with a wide-tooth comb. 

I'd love to let my natural waves go free, but I'm finding that my hair seems to want to be blown dry straight. I am thinking that the heat of the blow dryer helps the sebum penetrate the shaft or something? It definitely looks and feels the best when I blow dry it straight after a WO wash.

I'll add here that in the past I did try dry shampoos, but they left me unbearably itchy on the scalp, so much so, I had to hop in the shower. I'll also add that I am very hesitant to try BS or ACV, as I am reading mix reviews about their effects.

I've been trying out the no poo method for well over a month now, and I'm still having problems. My hair is straight and very fine, at collarbone length, half grown out natural and half damaged from bleach thanks to a mishap a couple years ago with a stylist. The worst of it has been cut off long ago but compared to my natural virgin hair it's an entirely different type of hair altogether. 

I don't shower often because of my eczema anyway, so I have already been keeping my hair washing to a minimum before I started going no poo, but I still can't find a balance. Every time I go through all the effort of BBB, masks, baking soda, vinegar, etc, my hair will ALWAYS come out after a shower being overly oily on my roots and dry as heck on the damaged parts and the ends. It's driving me up the wall. I already have naturally blonde hair so too much oil always stands out no matter what I do. As a result I end up having to put cornstarch into my freshly washed hair and I am starting to feel skeptical about people who talk about healthy shiny hair when mine has to end up being a matte mess all the time. 

I try honey, and my hair gets dry. I try oils, and I can't get them out unless I use egg which often I don't have the time for at that point. It's a nightmare. 
Currently I've had a honey and kefir mask on overnight, showered normally today and my ends are so dry they are crunchy, but still somehow oily roots despite doing baking soda and vinegar in the shower. 

For extra info: I have hard water, but I did get a shower filter. It's not a full water softener but its the best I can do. I also can't find any ACV where I am (Poland), so I've been using diluted white vinegar. I also dilute my baking soda quite a bit (about 1/5 to water). 

What am I missing here? Should I revert to using shampoo and conditioner until my damaged hair grows out completely?

4941,t3_85prnu,"**Background**

&amp;nbsp;

Ever since I've taken finding the right look and haircut for myself seriously, I've realized that every time I used shampoo, my hair would puff up and become frizzy after drying. I'm currently growing out my hair to go for a ""short on sides, long on top"" kind of haircut for my curly hair.

Something like this: https://i.imgur.com/bRQ1jNp.jpg

Right now I'm combing my hair flat to the side to avoid looking like an overgrown bush while I await my next haircut appointment.
I have thick, black, wavy hair (the degree of which is undetermined as I have not yet grown it long enough) with low porosity.

&amp;nbsp;

**Approach**

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I grabbed the bull by the horn and started off doing water only once a week on Fridays and am pleasantly surprised with the results. I have been sporadically following the scritching, preening, boar-bristle brushing (SPB) routine every 1-4 days, depending on how my scalp and hair feel from justprimalthings.com albeit not having a boar bristle brush, which I substituted by gripping bundles of hair with my fingers and running through their length in different patterns.

&amp;nbsp;

**Week 1**

* Hair feels much oilier, though not as bad as I've read through other posts. Hands feel quite oily after running hands through hair.
* Hair feels really solid, crusty, and clumpy after taking a shower, taking on a straw-like consistency and texture.
* Hair dried really quick and I had itchy / dry scalp later in the day, and next few days.

&amp;nbsp;

**Observations:**

I believe I my hair had a straw-like texture because I had just begun this schedule after using shampoo, I also used hot water when showering because I thought I would be A-OK as long as I did not use shampoo, however week 2 proved that wrong. I finished my shower with cold water (knob turned all the way). This is also the week when I used a lot of coconut oil on my ends to reverse the damage from using my old hair products.

&amp;nbsp;

**Week 2**

* Hair feels less oily, I feel like my oils have distributed themselves more evenly throughout my hair
* Hair feels softer, heavier, silkier, w/ more structural integrity and less frizz. This is more true in the front of my head rather than the back, which still somewhat has a straw-like texture. Perhaps I need to moisturize that area?
* No longer feels like straw and retains moisture for a really long time after combing and flattening it, and it stayed moist after drying.

&amp;nbsp;

**Observations:**

This time when showering, I used warm water instead of hot water. I think this helped to retain the natural oils from my hair and allow them to keep their ability to stay moisturized even after drying, since hot water strips too much oils and dries out my hair.

Another thing I've noticed is that when I use cold water to wash, it feels like there is a lot of friction going on between my fingers and my hair, however when I use warmer water the hair feels much softer when washing and less friction goes on. I definitely would have considered washing with cold water if it didn't feel like I was pulling my hair all the time. Can someone explain this? Rinsed with cold water to cool down hair and close up hairs sheaths and pores.

The pictures were taken at night, and my hair is completely dry in all of the photos. Its appearance today has deviated very little from the shape that I combed it into after my morning shower, and what astonishes me is the difference in how easily I can style my hair, how moisturized it feels, the difference in frizz, and how it keeps its shape. If you look at the last image with the top view of my head, you'll notice that the pattern of the hair at the front looks different than the pattern from the back. Compared to the front, the back is clumpier, frizzier, and drier, reminiscent of the old appearance of my hair - though not as much as when I first started.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion / TL;DR**

&amp;nbsp;

All in all, my hair has reduced in frizziness, has become much easier to sculpt, retains moisture better, feels softer, dries quicker, and is less oily on non-wash days. This is evident in the change of appearance of my frontal hair, although not as pronounced in the back parts of my scalp for some reason. Perhaps it needs time to catch up.

I used to wash my hair with a shampoo bar bur decided to try BS / ACV, which did not work for me it made my head so itchy. Then I tried washing with an egg and that worked really well but i have long hair and it was more expensive in eggs than shampoo! So i went back to the same shampoo bar but this time i have the waxies really badly and i can't figure out why. Does anyone know why this has happened or do you have a good remedy for it. Thanks.

4943,t3_85g2px,"Ever since I was a teenager I had incredibly greasy hair. If I showered that morning the grease would be clearly visible by the end of the day. My mom was like that too so I figured it was just genetics. 

Still, a couple years ago I was determined to stop using shampoo and I tried really hard at it for a few months since I didn't have to go outside for work. I read this sub a lot and tried all the suggestions. By the end of those months my hair was able to go a couple days without being covered in grease but the third day there was no way it looked presentable. I figured I was just doomed to super greasy hair all the time if I wanted to stay away from shampoo so I quit.

A few days ago I decided to try again. I'm on the 5th day of just washing with water and my hair is not greasy at all!! I'm going to have no trouble keeping it up this time and I'm so happy. 

The only reason I can imagine such a change is because a few weeks ago I started trying to be super healthy which included going vegan and cutting out all processed food. I haven't been pregnant or anything else I can think of that would have had an impact on my hormones. Literally the only changes I've made between now and two years ago is my diet. 

I didn't even eat a lot of meat in the first place either. I did eat a lot of processed food though. I could have guessed that quitting meat would result in somewhat less grease being produced but the difference is astounding to me. And it's only been a few days so I expect it to just get better as time goes on. I'd say probably half the hair is pulled out when I brush after showering and my head has stopped being itchy (I decided to quit shampoo again cause I was starting to get hives, yikes).

I just wanted to share that with you guys. Especially if you're already considering a lifestyle change, this is just one more reason to do it. I'm already feeling physically better than I have in my life too. It was a hard change to make but so worth it, and now I'm just waiting till my hair starts looking fuller and nicer too :D",NoPoo

4947,t3_852sc4,"I've been creeping on this forum but officially I'm brand new to reddit and I've joined now in desperate search for some WO help.
I feel like I've been doing EVERYTHING right but the last week and a half I've got a terrible waxy build-up and dandruff. This is gonna be a long one, I'm sorry...

I've been doing WO for a month, but have been no-poo for about a year and a half using shampoo bars and ACV. My hair is long and wavy/curly, not quite thin, but definitely not thick. So here's my routine:
The first couple of weeks of WO my hair got greasy obviously, but I was **scritching, preening and using my BBB** with good effect. I've been scritching and preening when washing as well, first with **hot water, then cold**. My hair's been a little greasy, but I've been able to wear it down for a day or so without looking too gross. I squeeze most water out of my hair and then put it up in a **t-shirt** for a couple of minutes only, and apply **jojoba oil** to the ends. I detangle with a wide toothed comb. I use my BBB every other night before bed, and I sleep on a **silk pillowcase** that I rinse every other day if I'm too lazy to do a proper wash. I sometimes BBB in the morning if my hair is very greasy. I've been **washing every two or three days**. I know for sure I have **soft water** so that shouldn't be a problem. The last week I also tried washing with **only cold water**, but it just didn't dissolve anything properly and hair looked the same as when I got in the shower.

I had little specks of dandruff in varying amounts when I was nopoo, but nothing like this. This feels as if I've used a no poo bar with no ACV rinse in hard water for the first time ever... It's difficult to preen even because it's so waxy. My brush is also covered in white dust after having thoroughly cleaned it and used it just one time. What the fork is up with my hairs!? I really really want so bad to be WO and it's so frustrating when I feel like I've been doing everything right, I was on the right track and now I'm just confused and have bad hair..

**TLDR; Please read the bolds anyway I'm sorry this is so long!!!**

But with the oncoming hot weather I sweat and notice my hair getting oilier and less voluminous. Should i do something else to solve the oily issue now that it's going to get hotter where I live? 
The only thing I've done thus far is water wash every other day and scrub scalp and my hair has been fine. ",NoPoo
4969,t3_813leg,"I've been doing No-Poo for about two months, and I want to share some things I've noticed/potential benefits, for all the struggling people out there.

A bit of background first: my hair is about shoulder-length, mostly straight, not very dense, extremely low-porosity, and has leftover highlights. I've had various scalp issues, and my hair has always gotten really oily really fast, and so I've tried various methods, but I never washed it more than once every 5 days because it was too much of a hassle. Before really starting no-poo I had been unknowingly using a silicone-free shampoo, and I had also been dilluting it, so my transition period was definitely not as bad as it could've been.
So here are some changes I've noticed:

**Hair never feels gross** - No matter what conventional shampoo I used, my hair would always get really greasy at the crown on day 3, and it would kind of clump together, so much so that I could barely run my hands through it. Now, while it never feels as 'clean' as it used to with conventional shampoo, even after 7 days of not washing it doesn't feel half as gross as it used to after 3 days. I could go a lot longer and it would be fine, but I choose not to because for once in my life I actually enjoy washing it.

**Never feels dried out** - With conventional shampoo, it always felt like I had two different hair textures: the crown always oily and clumped together, but the roots always dry and brittle. Whereas now its texture in general feels different, more uniform, with the highlights only a tiny bit drier than the rest, but not enough to be a problem. Also I never get tangles anymore.

**More volume** - Conventional shampoo always made it frizzy, unnaturally puffy, and really hard to manage. Now it has more volume, it never looks limp, no matter what I use on it, and the individual strands feel a lot stronger.

**Grows faster** - I never really wanted to grow it out, but there was always a point when it kind of just... stopped growing, even if I trimmed it regularly. But now it grows incredibly fast, probably because of all the brushing and massaging I've been doing. 

**Less scalp problems** - I'm pretty sure I have seb-derm, but on top of that I would often get random bursts of dandruff, and I didn't know what to do about it, apart from buying anti-dandruff shampoo, which didn't do anything. There might not be much I can do against the seb-derm, but at least now the rest of my scalp never feels dry, flaky, or itchy as it used to, so I'm satisfied.

**No more hair-loss** - I had a period of time when for whatever reason I lost so much hair on a daily basis, it was really bothersome, but I didn't know the cause. Now I brush it a lot more often than I used to, but even then, and even when I wash it, I don't think I lose a third the amount that I used to.

**Dries slower** - I don't know how much of a good thing this is, but it definitely doesn't start drying as soon as I get out of the shower as it used to. I had a few weeks when it didn't feel dry even after half a day, but now it takes about 4-5 hours at most. Might be my hair freaking out, or the cold weather. I'm not too bothered.

For reference, I started No-Poo by using stuff like honey, tea, rye flour, etc. for a few weeks, and deep-conditioning often. I haven't yet found a method that works perfectly long-term, but I've been experimenting with shampoo bars, and at least I've found some natural things my hair likes (mostly acidic stuff. Fermented rice water works wonders). If I find a shampoo bar I like, I might stick with that for a while, but my long-term goal is to go water-only, if possible.

What worked for me might not work for you, but if you're struggling, I would strongly suggest not to give up, just try different things, and most of all, listen to your hair. You'll get there one day. ",NoPoo

Because of that, i decided to try the baking soda and chamomile tea method of cleansing (i didn't had any acv in hand) just to get rid of the oil. My goal was to be water only if it was possible.
I did the recommended 1 tbsp per cup. And the baking soda felt very slippery, until i rinsed it off and it felt kind of hard? Now my hair feels harder and even greasier. Yet i noticed when i brush, it left like a white residue on the bristles. And upon close inspection, my hair has tiny white dots too ): 

I do have dandruff however since i started the nopoo it seems  to have calmed a bit. I read the sidebar and thought this may be because of the water. Maybe it's just too hard for me to be water only. So i have a couple questions:

1.- should i go back to shampoo?

So I’ve been trying to go fully no poo for about 6 months, but I never really managed to go past 1-2 weeks without washing my hair with a sulfate free shampoo. My hair would get stringy and unmanageable, my head would get itchy, and I’d get cystic pimples all over my scalp that would make the hair fall out

I tried different methods; boar bristle brushes, lemon washes, ACV washes, leaving it as long as I could. The best method I ever came across was mixing about a teaspoon of Tea Tree oil with 1-2 tablespoons of water, and lathering that in my hair. Helped a lil with the itchiness and made my hair a bit softer, but never completely helped. My hair would still get gross and oily and itchy a few days later.

Enter aloe vera. 
At my parents house we have heaps of massive Aloe plants, which I frequently use on my skin. 
I mixed about a tablespoon of aloe with 2 tablespoons of water, and a few drops of rosemary oil and tea tree oil.

I left the aloe mix in my hair for 3 hours before rinsing it out in the shower, not following up with any shampoo or conditioner

It’s been nearly a week and my hair isn’t even slightly oily. It’s so soft and manageable; it’s never been this nice! 
Aloe vera has the same PH balance as our hair (6), so I believe it perfectly conditions it. Unlike other methods, like ACV and lemon which are slightly more acidic than our hair, the aloe balances our hair so the scalp doesn’t need to produce more oils! 

TLDR: Mix 1 tablespoon aloe with 1-2 tablespoons water, and a few drops of an oil of your choice for the nicest, most amazing hair of your life!

4991,t3_7xo0vj,"Hello. I am currently using a sulphate free shampoo and a silicone free conditioner.
After I stopped using silicones, 3 months ago I saw how my real hair looked and was so shocked that I refused to go back to sulphates/silicones to allow it to grow stronger and healthier from now on.


I have dry, brittle and very thin hair. I wash my hair every 5 days. It starts looking a bit greasy at the roots around the 3rd-4th day. But the ends are always dry.

 

Therefore!
What shampoo/conditioner would you advise me to start with? Any suggestions for a routine? All suggestions are greatly appreciated.
Thank you

1. Near the end of the week it gets super dandruff-y and itchy. I've never had dandruff so do I need to wash more often? Or will it adjust? I'm trying to was less because it feels so nice and soft towards the end of the week and I lose that when I wash it.

4995,t3_7xhk1n,"I'm a male. Trying to grow long hair. I don't really know or remember when i entered the awkward stage, but i think i am still in it, as i dont find my hair flattering. They just dont fall down the way i want them. The only thing right now that makes me feel somewhat attractive is a bun. And with my lenght its not a twist bun but a fold bun.
I noticed that when I wash my hair with shampo (and conditioner) my hair gets very puffy when it dries. Doesn't matter if I let it dry naturally or if i blowdry, when it dries it just gets super puffy which makes it unmanageable. It just settles into a middlepart which to me (at least at this lenght) looks awful and if i try to flip it to one one side it just falls back and wiggles around. If i try to make bun (probably cuz of my lenght) the front hair just escapes the rubber band, meaning i have to tie it up all over again every now and then. It doesn't have any grip. But when a day or sometimes two days go since shamooping its much easier to manage. Easier to flip it over to one side and make it stay like that, and much easier to make a bun.
I read that sulphates makes your hair puffy. So i bought sulphate free shampoo and for now i washed my hair three timss with it. Its still puffy afterwards but much less than with regular shampoo with sulphates. And a bit easier to manage on the first day.

Now I'm here asking: if i go nopoo will my hair always look and feel like the second day hair and be easier to manage? (i dont really mind if i have to water wash it every day, just so it doesnt look puffy). 

And also I saw on youtube a girl talking about nopoo and she was not satisfied. She said it made her hair gummy, and when she started using shampoo again her hair stayed gummy. I dont think i want that. So how often does it happen that someone gets gummy hair? Does it depend on hair type and skint type or did that girl do something wrong?

And also i think i have quite greasy hair. On day three or four i already have to wash it cuz i look gross and actually feels gummy like the youtuber girl said. So could that potentially be a problem?
Other than oily, grease hair, i never had much problems with my scalp (no itchiness; never had much or actually any dandruff at all, even when i had shorter hair and used styling products, although with short hair i did wash it with water only and every day, but thats short hair now i am growing it long and its already quite long).

The ends are dry but I want to see where it goes on a longer run. I saw that I'm suppose to use cold water to keep the sebum from going away and produce more and to close the pores. But, I just can't use cold water, even just for a minute. My brain won't allow it and I will probably be grumpy all day long. I know it is a caprice but you know, we all have some.

My method is basically very throughly rinsing with the hottest water I can stand about once a week. That seems to be enough. Afterwards I use a concoction my sister made called ""leg balm"". Basically my Dad has varicose veins, so my sister tried to make him something to rub into his legs. Its a mix of coconut oil, sunflower oil, beeswax, and some other stuff she wouldn't tell me. I essentially use it like hair wax, but it doesn't leave my hair feeling greasy. You have to heat it up in your hands to melt the beeswax, but after that its just like any hair wax. I don't have to do anything else to my hair after that, it maintains pretty good volume and doesn't blow around in the wind much. People still ask me how I get my hair to look so good, and its really satisfying to tell them I literally put less effort in than anyone they know.

I started doing this years ago, back when I had long hair (first year of college ftw). I would get tangles, dandruff and split ends constantly. Eventually I went travelling and had no access to showers, and after two months I came back home and everyone commented on how healthy my hair looked. I just never restarted washing it from then on. During those two months, it was a little uncomfortable to have natural oils in my hair, but I stopped noticing it after a while. The benefits quickly outweighed any negatives.

The only downside is I occasionally get an itchy scalp, but thats usually a good indicator that it needs a through rinse. I rinse more often in hot weather too.",NoPoo

I dilute the juice of half a lemon on 500 ml of water and use that to wash my hair, but i don't rinse the lemon water because if i do, the hard water makes my hair waxy again.

The problem i have is that sometimes i feel my scalp a little bit irritated, always have white flakes on my hair and when i put my fingers on my scalp, it feels dry with almost no oil.

If i use any less than half a lemon on 500 ml of water, it makes no effect and it's like washing with only water. So i wanted to ask if there is something i can do to stop the white flakes and dryness in the scalp. So far i've found on the internet that aloe vera spray may help.

(Also, because i live in Venezuela, i don't have access to more fancy stuff such as essential oils which are hard to find or very expensive due to the economic situation, or rye flour, which doesn't exist here because rye isn't grown here.

And you can probably guess why I was using H&amp;S before I ditched shampoo altogether.  I was hoping that NoPoo would solve my dandruff issue but here I am a year later and while I am thrilled with the texture and life of my hair, it ironically didn't do the one thing I was hoping it would.

I was hoping I could get some input on changing up my routine to try to curb this issue.

5029,t3_blrdtf,"[Video on 5 Great Alternatives to Shampoo](https://youtu.be/Eo8wvesS1kk)

Hello Reddit!It’s FreeDaFro here to deliver the knowledge once again. Today, I will share with you 4 great alternative to Shampoo. As you already know from reading my previous videos, Shampoo is the enemy of my hair. Shampoo takes sebum oil out of your. By stripping your hair of sebum oil, shampoo can cause dry hair, breakage, and decreased hair growth.

The four methods I’m sharing with you today do not throw off your hair’s balance of sebum oil. All of these methods that I am sharing with you today are cheap and naturals. If you want stronger, darker, and thicker hair, I recommend that your use a combination of all of these methods. Each product provides its own unique benefits and the use of a variety of products will produce maximize your hair’s potential over time. These methods are list in no particular order. I find all of these products essential to my hair care regimen.

So here we go:

#1 Onion Juice:

So the first product I recommend you guys to start using is onion juice.
Onion juice is a cheap &amp; natural way to speed up you hair growth.  Onions are great for your hair and body. Onions contain a high amount of sulfur. Sulfur will speeds up your hair growth.Sulfur kills bacteria that rest on your scalp. These bacteria block clog our scalp and prevent hair follicles from emerging from our scalp. Sulfur removes this blockage allowing our hair to grow faster. Sulfur allows helps to remove dandruff from our scalp. Onion juice allows increases the blood flow to your scalp leading to increased hair growth.


Since I started using onion juice in my hair, my hair has become thicker and darker. When you first use it, your scalp will feel like its on fire. That feeling is the onion juice killing all of the bacteria in your hair. I know the idea of putting onion juice in your hair may be appalling to some people. Some of you may be concerned about a lingering onion smell being left in your hair after your hair after you use this method. I usually put  castor oil and conditioner in my hair after I use onion juice. This helps reduce the smell of onions in my hair.

If you want to make onion juice, all you simply need to is cut up and boil and onion. Let the mixture sit in your hair for 1 -2 hours. After letting it sit, rinse your hair with water. Make sure you avoid getting this product in your eyes.

If you commit to using onion juice on a consistent basis, you will see your hair get thicker and fuller.

#2 Clay Mask:

The next thing I recommend you guys try is a clay mask. 
Clay is another natural product of the earth. There are great clays out there Each has its own unique benefits. There are many recipes online but all these recipes have some of the same benefits.
Clays masks do a great job of detoxifying our hair. Tap water contains harmful metals such as lead and chlorine. Overtime, these metals build up in our hair and damage our scalp. Clay’s magnetic properties allow it to carry the metals out of our hair. Clay also kill bacteria in our scalp.

Another great thing about clay mask is that they remove oily buildup from our hair strands. Clays act like a sponge in our hair and they will soak up excess oil that lies on our hair strands. As clays coat our hair strand, it begins to fill in holes on our hair stands. This strengthens our hair and improves our curly pattern.

As I said, there are many clays for our scalp, each has its own benefits. Clay is a great alternative to shampoo because its PH level is more favorable to our scalp. Clay is a gentler way to clean your hair and it reinforces the damaged spots on your hair, unlike shampoo.  There are many clay mask recipes online. I recommend you use this product to remove build-up on your hair.


#3 Apple Cider Vinegar:

The next one I am gonna share you guys is a popular one. Apply Cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is a staple in the natural hair care community. Apple cider vinegar can remove dirty from your hair. Its best property is its ability to break apart sebum oil. When sebum oil is broken into tinier particles, it is easier to move from your scalp to your hair strands. Remember sebum is good from our hair strands because it seals help to seal in moisture. 

Since I started using apple cider vinegar my hair has become more flexible and shiny. I can comb my hair in every direction. I’ve also notice my hair has beomce more shiny too.

* Nice spray cleanse
* Adds shine
* Makes hair easier to manipulate

#4: Co-washing:

Y’all have probably heard of this one before. Co washing is a conditioner only wash. Cowashing creates a protective layer over your hair strands that help seal in moisture. Co washing is a great way to clean your hair throughout the week. If you just came back from the beach or the gym, it is a great way to quickly refresh your hair without removing any oil. 

Be careful. If done incorrectly, co washing can be harmful for our hair. The protective layer created by cowashing doesn’t allow moisture to penetrate into it. If this protective layer is always on your hair, you will not be able to get water into your hair. Overtime you will experience hair breakage. Also avoid putting conditioner on your scalp, conditioner will clog the pores on your scalp. 

You can cowash with any hair conditioner. I recommend that co wash no more that 3 times a week.",NoPoo

Thanks for all the responses so far. I use OGX coconut shampoo and conditioner (wasn’t before but doesn’t seem to make a difference). Have tried normal dandruff shampoos. Going to buy t-gel tar shampoo and try that. Sounding like a dermatologist is the only way to figure it out if that doesn’t work. I don’t want to try one of these methods for a possible misdiagnosis while it gets worse. Any thoughts?

EDIT 2: Scritching 

I watched some videos, I feel anxious massaging my scalp and pulling my hair. seems damaging.. thoughts? Can Get a brush. Im just literally pulling the hair I already am losing out over this.

EDIT 3: Thanks so far everyone. Learning a lot.",NoPoo

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I have long, straight hair that gets greasy on day two, and I just think washing it is boring. I tried no poo for about 6 months a couple of years ago, but ended up ditching it after travelling a lot and dealing with different kinds of water.   


I've read that scritching, preening and BBBing is essential to no poo, but is that absolutely necessary, or is that just if you do WO?   


I've just started up a no poo routine again, and am currently washing once a week with diluted baking soda (1 tbsp BS + 1 cup water) and using diluted white wine vinegar as a leave-in conditioner. (works amazeballs, but isn't the BS removing a lot of the natural oils? Seeing as the hair gets so squeaky clean) My plan is to move to rye flour after a couple of weeks, when the transition phase is hopefully over, because I've read that BS is damaging to your hair over time. And rye flour worked well the last time I tried it, if I remember correctly.  


Any tips for me? Also, do I really need to deep condition? If so, what's the easiest vegan way to do it?

As of today, I'm at 9 days, with a hint of grease, but since finding this sub I'v learned that the light amount of cornstarch I use is okay, and that my hair is healthy via a pull test someone posted. My question is really just about why I get an itchy scalp after about five days. 

I moved to a much more humid climate about four years ago and also let my hair grow from about 4"" long to about 24"". At first I thought it was from pulling it into a pony tail, but I cut my hair last Saturday so the longest part is now about 8 inches long, and I'm still dealing with the itching problem.

I've been on and off water only for a bit now. I'm on and off because of my lifestyle and because I love the feeling of super squeaky clean hair. 

I have dry, damaged and thick Asian hair but after lots of botched box dyes and allergic reactions to conditioners to relieve the damage, I've lost/broken alot of it. Weaning into water only really helped the damage and growth, but every time it would get a little too oily, I'd give into shampoo. 

But recently I discovered Shikakai and Reetha Powder as shampoo -- and OH MY GOSH GUYS. My hair is soft, sleek, and moisturized, and it has that squeaky clean feeling. My hair has less breakage and it looks like it too!  

If you guys have not tried it, I highly recommend it. I also live in a college town with moderately hard water, and still dont need an acv rinse. I'm super excited that this is working out and that this is so much better than what I could've expected! I'm really surprised not more people are talking about it.

5056,t3_bg6aw1,"Hi NoPoo-ers. 

I've started nopoo for 2.5 months by only using baking soda and vinegar wash once ever two days (I seriously didn't know it's not recomended). My hair grew out so fast. All my life I've combatted hair thinning and this transition worked so well my hair has never been so thick! FYI I am asian with black straight hair and has thin hair genetics. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Then I went to the beach and gave into shampoo because I didn't have baking soda with me. That was for a week, then I came home and continued using shampoo because I was out of baking soda. I switched back to shampoo for 2 -3 weeks and finally came back to baking soda. It's still working - my hair is beautiful but it's not the same anymore as when I started. I'm one week back into baking soda &amp; vinegar and washing it once every 2-3 days, but I have been feeling that the baking soda maybe too strong for me, so today I tried just water and then dandruffs appeared right away.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also going to dye my hair next week with chemical. I don't want natural alternative simply because I don't know how to get the right color and has no experience in dying it myself ever. My question is what should be my nopoo routine? I have a BBB that I don't use as well. I've read so many articles about dying hair and alternative nopoo routine, but there are too many choices and I don't know which one would work best.

5063,t3_bf91d4,"Hello everyone! I started no poo water only two months ago. I used to wash my hair with Lush shampoo bars or a natural bar I bought on a market in Turkey (they said it was made from olive oil). No conditioner. 

I am currently travelling around Asia and therefore I mostly only wash my hair with cold water. It never felt clean after a wash, actually just more oily. I try to really wash it and rub my scalp a lot. I also dry my hair with a t shirt instead of a towel. I see no difference.

I have thin hair, but because of my waves it doesn't look that way. In those two months it actually looks fine and full. It's just that the feel is very very very oily. I can not get with my fingers through my hair all the way from the scalp. I thought it was just part of the transition but yesterday I noticed very gross and thick layers of, as it looks like, fat/oil build up near my scalp that make my hairs get stuck to each other. I was able to brush those out with three different kind of brushes. A round soft brush, a tangle teezer and a fine comb. That made my whole hair more oily instead of mostly at the scalp. In those last two months I just used the soft round brush, maybe I couldn't reach my scalp that way and therefore the build up?

I am currently in India and it's kind of hard to get a BBB. Same for the shampoos without silicones or sulfates. So I'd rather go through this process without. Is that even possible? Will it just take longer and do I have to be patience? Or am I doing something wrong?

1. I use hair oils a lot, like Coconut oil, Almond oil, Argan oil etc.  and usually wash them out with a shampoo. How would I go about washing them out if I'm going nopoo? Or do I just rub my scalp with normal water and let the oils hopefully soak in and fade away naturally? And I usually condition too, is conditioning recommended during nopoo? And a certain kind? Or is any old conditioner fine?
2. I aim to dye my hair once I'm done with college, in about 2 months or so. I haven't admittedly read up on maintaining dyed hair and all yet since the act is still far off, but is it okay to go nopoo while having dyed hair? Would just conditioning maybe two-three times a week and using plain old water to rinse my hair be fine with dyed hair?

5068,t3_beuapg,"For years, I've had excessively oily hair that I have to wash several times a week. At first, I could go for maybe 3 days without washing, but it's gotten so bad now that my hair feels oily and my scalp is itchy the same day I wash my hair (I wash it in the morning). The second day it already looks terrible, is super itchy, and I think it smells. I put up with it to avoid washing it every day, but it's frustrating and makes me uncomfortable, especially at work. I'm thinking of trying lowpoo and eventually transitioning to using no shampoo, but I don't know where to start.

I bought a dry shampoo yesterday just to try it out, but I know it's not a real fix.

I have a lot of hair, but it is very thin and frizzy. It's medium length and chestnut brown. Near my forehead, it's very rough and broken. I also live in a place with humidity averaging 75% (usually ranges from 60-85%), which makes dealing with oily hair more difficult.

5069,t3_bel08f,"I'm travelling at the moment and I want to give no poo a try. Let me first fill you in on some background. I have normal skin that tends towards dehydration. My scalp health is good too. No dandruff or other scalp problems. My hair length goes to my shoulders and I have a fringe. I'm blessed with curly hair but if there's lots of moisture in the hair it's frizzy af. I can only achieve my curly hair through product and if I want it to really bang, I need heat too. I've some blonde at the bottom half of my hair which is in good condition. I currently can get 5-6 days from each wash. My hair always looks it's best on day 3-4, because the natural oils dampen down the frizz and flyaways. I never use dry shampoo because I'm lazy. 

Now for my routine. Before I get into the shower, I run my fingers vigorously over my scalp for a few minutes. I find this is really helping with the itchiness. When I'm in the shower, I scrub my scalp under the hot water as if I'm washing my hair as usual. I'm not conditioning my hair shafts but I don't have any. I don't brush my hair because I've curly hair and it makes my hair frizzy. I've no idea if the water in the countries I visit have hard or soft water. I'm travelling through the middle East and Central Asia, with a single 40L bag, so I don't have a ton of space. 

I'm only 7 days in and I'm really feeling the grease. At the front of my head it's okay, but the back of my crown is flat with oil. Luckily I'm in a country that requires me to wear a headscarf but this won't be the case in a few days. I'm not at home so when I go to a shop to buy conditioner, I have no idea what I'm buying. The hair shafts are in good condition and I think I'm getting a good distribution of the oil through my hair, save for the back where it seems to be gathering. 

Now, I'm looking for some feedback on 2 fronts. How does my routine sound? How did you cope with the transition? Curly haired no poo people, how do you spread your hair's natural loveliness through to the ends without compromising your curl? Those who started when travelling, what did you do? How did you adapt your no poo when you don't have access to the same products at home.

I've read around that scritching (?) is enough to clean the scalp (?), but that took too much time out of my morning routine. I bought a shampoo brush and use that to scritch instead.

I started that routine and didn’t wash my hard after 10/17/18. However, two weeks ago, my hair just got extremely oily and heavy at the roots and so very, very dry at the ends. I was at a loss... I stopped coconut oil and just did aloe vera and ACV, but it didn’t cut it. 

Finally, I Googled natural shampoos for SD and found WOW, an ACV shampoo on Amazon. Since my trouble was so immediate, I called my local beauty shop to see if they sold ACV shampoo and they didn’t, but suggested Whole Foods. I picked up Avalon Organics ACV shampoo and conditioner. 

I’ve been in Heaven since!! She shampoo is so cleansing and leaves my hair squeaky clean and the conditioner is so rich and creamy, my hair is just wonderfully soft.. and my hands, too!!! 

It’s all natural ingredients, no sulfates and other junk. I do have a little, tiny itch by my ears, so I might pre-treat with ACV/water mix before shampoo next time. Otherwise, my hair looks and feels great!!! Lots of body, no flyaways.. and, when I want to “go curly”, it’s not frizzy like it usually is.

My scalp is still very itchy and I often do a fast shampoo with hot water and tea tree essential oil in between shampoo instead of the hot water only. I wonder if I'm doing anything wrong ? Is it normal for the essential oil not to prevent itchiness during the whole week ?

By the way my hairs are short, my scalp is dry and the roots of my hairs can be oily but the tips are dry. I do no have dandruff, just dead skin du to the scratching...

Can anyone help or share its experience ?

I'm not a ""no-pooer"" but I am now considering it since reading about it but that's beside the point. I wasnt sure where else to ask this so it seems like a community of lots of boar bristle brush users might be the place.

I bought my BBB as I read its good for fine hair, oily at the roots, dry at the ends.

I've used it twice now and both times left my scalp REALLY itchy afterwards.

I've suspected for a long time that shampooing was the cause of my dandruff and scalp issues.

5155,t3_b15zpg,"I've been water-only for something like a year... been using hybrid boar bristle brushes for even longer. They are fantastic, I love them, but I hate cleaning them, and since the brush is basically responsible for cleaning your hair rather than shampoo, it really needs to be kept clean to work properly.

I have been tweaking my routine for a while. I used to shampoo the brush, but I was always low-poo (once a week or less) and this really wasn't enough, plus it was very hard on the brush.

I used a metal comb on my brushes for a long time, (I think this was also hard on them) and occasionally take a dental pick and run it through the individual bunches of boar hair (I still haven't found anything else that will really get the stuck lint out of the bristle clusters).

This year I switched away from the metal comb and bought a hairbrush cleaning tool, with thick plastic bristles. This doesn't go between as effectively as the comb, but if I brush the surface of the brush, it gets nearly all of the smaller hairs that don't come off by hand, and it loosens the dust for the final stage... which is an electric duster (meant to replace compressed air cans for cleaning the computer).

So the hairbrush cleaner, plus air-blast approach seems to be working okay for me as a daily cleaning solution, with occasional deep cleaning by dental pick... it feels ridiculous to put so much thought/effort into maintaining a hairbrush, but when I slack off on it, I end up removing dust tangles from my hair... not to mention using a hairbrush that looks like the inside of a vacuum bag... *sigh*",NoPoo

I wash my hair once every 1.5 weeks with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, but I am trying to extend these stretches and eventually transition to no-poo. I do not wet my hair between washes. I also have an extremely sensitive scalp, and I had sebborheic  dermatitis and exczema as a child, which I grew out of. 

I am fairly certain I have hard water and am aware that water only is not an option for me. At about the 1 week mark of no washing, my scalp becomes extremely sensitive and painful to the touch, and I can barely tie it up or even part it. I have tried brushing my hair with a natural bristle brush as well as massaging my scalp with my fingertips, but it hurts so bad I can barely do more than a few minutes before I have to stop.

I use aloe vera twice a week overnight and rinse with apple cider vinegar (acv). Any other time in the week that I need to get rid of any oily hair (doesn’t happen often) I rinse with acv. 

I still blow dry and straighten with a hot brush. 

I also brush my hair every morning and night with a boar bristle brush for about 5 minutes. My shoulder length hair is growing fast, and the hair I lost from the SD seems to be growing back. 

I color my hair to cover grays, and the color doesn’t sting my scalp any longer and since I’m a redhead and color red/auburn, it’s no longer brassy. My hair takes the color and it’s a beautiful auburn that looks so natural no one can tell I’ve colored even5 minutes after I’m done.

I wash about twice a week with about 1/2-1 tsp baking soda and rinse with a splash of white vinegar. I felt like my hair was doing great - until I took a bath a week ago, which is something I don't usually do. I did my normal wash routine but in the bath (there was no soap in the water). Afterwards, I put a small pump of argon oil in my wet hair as it was feeling a bit dry. I then proceeded to get about 4 inches cut off my hair.

I didn't let the stylist use any products on my hair. But after it dried my hair was - well, it's hard to describe. Almost sticky?..I can't run my fingers through it anymore. And, overall, it's just looking bleh. 

I thought maybe somehow washing it in the bath messed it up (I have no idea how, but just trying to make some sense of it!).

5172,t3_axo86g,"Hey all, I've been basically shampoo free for about 9 years. I wanted to offer some thoughts and advice, because I have seen lots of posts by people just starting, or who have done it for a year or two, but not much from people like me, who've done it many years.

First, my qualifications. I first heard of the notion of not using shampoo a long time ago, and thought it made sense, so figured I'd try it. Worst case scenario it didn't work and I'd go back to shampooing every other shower. It did work, and I haven't stopped. I've had everything from shoulder length hair to buzz cut, so I have experience with varying lengths.

I say I've been basically shampoo free, because I will still occasionally use shampoo. I do a lot of projects, woodworking, tinkering on my old lawn tractor, brickwork/masonry, and other messy hobbies. Every once in a while, my hair gets too dirty for just water, and I will use shampoo. I have used shampoo probably no more than 4-6 times in the past 9 years. I am not opposed to using shampoo when it is needed, I just am not using it on a constant basis.

My routine is straightforward. I don't have extremely oily hair, which may be from not using shampoo for so long. I generally shower every 2-4 days on average, depending on the weather and my activity level. Summer I may shower every day, in winter when I'm not leaving the house, it may be 4-5 days. I know, that is along stretch to go between showers. I'm a stay-at-home dad of four young kids, and some weeks I don't do enough to warrant showering more often. I smell myself before my wife does, and she tells me if she ever smells me. Don't judge...

Anyway, when I shower, usually in the evening, I get my head under the water and scrub my hair and scalp with my fingernails. I use my nails to exfoliate my scalp, and use my fingers to wash out anything that might have gotten in my hair. I'm not talking about scratching my scalp till it hurts or bleeds, just giving it a good scalp massage/scratch. When I get out, I towel dry, and will give it a quick comb if it's long enough. That's it. No egg yolks, mayo, yogurt, baking soda, vinegar, etc...

Now, I've seen a lot of posts saying their hair is 'oily', and I'm not really sure what the posters mean. When I run my hands through my hair, there will be a slight feeling of oil on my hands. That is normal. That is what hair does. It makes some oil to protect the hair shafts from drying out, and keep the hair healthy and voluminous. We want that oil, which is why we stop stripping our hair with shampoo.

It is very similar to the coating of oil on a cast iron pan. If you are unfamiliar with this notion, it is like this. After using a cast iron pan, you want to put a thin coating of oil on the iron to protect the pan. Most people will pour a little oil in the pan, then use a paper towel to wipe out the excess oil. When finished, there are not pools of oil in the pan, just a nice, even, thin sheen. If you rub your palm across the pan, your palm will also have a thin coating of oil. Thin enough that you could probably just rub it in your hands like lotion and it would disappear.

Similarly, if you run your hands through your hair, you will feel a small amount of natural oils on your fingers. To me it feel like that very last bit of lotion that gets trapped between your fingers, and you have to get your thumb or other fingers down at the base to get it out. That's what my hands feel like after running my fingers through my hair, and that is not 'oily hair' that is natural hair.

I do not generally need hair products, gels, hair spray, or the like, because generally my hair is short enough I don't need it. When I do need it though, I will use it. I don't change my routine to get it out either. I may spend just a few more minutes washing my hair to get it all out. Generally though, natural hair shouldn't be bothered by hair products, unless you are using them to excess.

If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer as best I can.

TLDR: I've been doing this a long time, you (frankly) probably don't need many of the ""alternatives"" that are pushed, and some oil in your hair is normal and nothing to be worried about.",NoPoo

5174,t3_axl8uv,"Hi! I've been happily no poo for over 2 years now. I use Hesh powders (Aritha, Shikakai, Amla, Brahmi and Rose) to clean my hair once a week, then put coconut oil on regularly to moisturise.

I wouldn't want to ruin the progress I've made with my hair but I could do with some more hydration.

I am not thinking about giving up, though. I'm going to continue with this, as my hair looks better overall, has less split ends and the maintenance is the cheapest ever.

On top of this, I have sobria on my face (my whole family has it, even though all of our diets are very different), so my skin is already extremely dry. I’ve had to put aveeno lotion on my face every day to stop peeling/redness. Since I grew a short beard, with these dry skin problems it means I’m also battling endless beard dandruff/flakes, Which I am able to keep at bay most of the time by rubbing aveeno into the skin beneath my beard. (I’ve tried beard oils, and mixing coconut oil products with Argan oils and have not found anything that has worked besides aveeno).

\-same brush routine as the AM, but I spritz a tea tree/peppermint essential oil toner (that I made) on my scalp to keep the flakes and funk at bay (I'm really happy with how this is working out)

\-usually braid it or toss it into a topknot to sleep

\-LAST NIGHT ONLY: did a water only rinse for the first time, my hair seemed like it was drying well then I put it in a bun when it was 90% dry (hoping for some easy waves in the morning, when I used shampoo this was my go-to), when I woke up my hair was noticeably less oily looking. Felt about the same, but it looked better. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main questions are how much longer until my scalp re-calibrates and how often should I do water only rinses? Will 2 days in a row be too often?

I heard finasteride helps with hair loss but has bad side effects like ED/limp dick.  I also heard Rogaine works great but if I stop I'd lose the hair grown from it within 3-6 months.  So I'm left with using no poo ""shampoo"", a shampoo that helps with hair loss and a conditioner recommended from /r/nopoo.


I have noticed my hair thinning about 4 years ago and recently my hair growth is half of what it used to be.  I have no family member with baldness so I don't think I'm getting thinning hair from genes.  I'm hoping cleaning my hair with no poo shampoo, a shampoo for hair loss and conditioner that isn't bad for my scalp/hair would do the trick in getting my hair back but like I said my hair loss/thinning hair has been noticeable since 4 years ago.

And I'm just curious is it ok for me to wash my hair with only water on days I don't use a shampoo or wash my hair with the no poo shampoo everyday?  I work at a job that has a high chance of making me sweat and if I don't wash my hair then it smells terrible, like a heavy oily smell.",NoPoo

Hey there,

So I recently came across lots of posts about people's journeys and I thought I'd actually contribute, since certain groups of us run into the same problems and it's also nice to hear what others think and to have direct advice. Since I'm new to this subreddit, let me know if I should correct anything (format, etc.)

Hair: shoulder-length, straight and very dark (Asian), on the finer side but I do have a lot of it, so I have a pretty full head of hair. 

I tried giving up on shampoo a few years back and used a honey/ cinnamon mix once every week. My hair was so dead and grey that I gave up after 6 weeks and tried using a natural shampoo bar that was also meant to be used once a week, but it felt waxy and didn't change the fact that my hair felt dense and heavy, and there was a lot of build-up. This was all due to hard water, and since I didn't want to invest in a filter, I just went back to cheap and crappy shampoo.

Due to me picking up a sport, I started washing my hair every day, and I knew it was so bad for it. Bear in mind that my hair has always looked okay on the outside. The only aesthetic issue I had was that, due to all the washing, my hair would get so greasy very quickly. Then I started to think about how much I was wasting as well as the fact that constant shampooing is genuinely something that was recently deeply drilled into us as a necessity, when in fact (in the greater scheme of things) it isn't. 

So, I decided to try again.

Firstly, I slowly cut down the length of time between washes (every other day for 2 weeks, every 3 days for 2/3 weeks, twice a week for 2 weeks, then I stopped)

1st 2 weeks of no poo: green tea to ""scrub"" my scalp and hair, followed by black tea as a rinse (I think I read somewhere that the former was alkaline and the latter acidic and I thought I could achieve a 5.5ish pH balance) and just normal hard water to wash it out at the end.

This was perfectly good, since I used a boar bristle brush every night, that I also regularly cleaned. I washed my hair twice a week and it still had a good amount of volume. However, there was still build-up in my hair and towards the end of the second week, my hair started getting dense and grey again.

Very unhappy, I looked into managing that and found that making my acidic rinse more acidic (with lemon juice) should help. And it really did! My hair is no longer waxy, but on the other hand it is far too conditioned; it gets oily really quickly (within a day), though the oil is well distributed throughout the hair. So I reduced the amount of lemon (1 squeezed lemon in about 700ml of black tea instead of two), and this is my third day of oily hair, but oily in a manageable sense.

At the moment, I don’t really want to buy a water filter for my showerhead, but I do use my parents’ filter jug and then boil the water for the tea. Do you think I should go back to limiting the amount of days between washes gradually, or that I should reduce the amount of lemon in the black tea? Also, is saltwater (I use dead sea salt solution to treat my eczema) good for making hair a less oily? Or will that also encourage your scalp to overproduce?

Though I had a bit of a hiccough with the hard water, I do really believe that the lemon helped a huge amount. My boar bristle brush has barely any grey fluff/ waxy bits from brushing my hair, and I feel like my hair is at least evenly oily, instead of greasy at the roots and dry at the ends.

When it comes to how my hair looks, a couple of people have commented on how it looks healthier, but bear in mind that this no poo journey is the only time I’ve properly cared for my hair. From about 12 until 20, I didn’t even own a hairbrush (though my hair was midway down my torso at one point) and I never cared about how it looked, other than if it was too greasy – so I never, ever used conditioner, though in hindsight that probably would have made my head less oily. So now that I brush my hair daily, of course I’m crazy glad not to find my hair everywhere at home, but I don’t know if I’m just shedding it all into my brush, given that I never used to brush my hair. Also, even though I used to dye and bleach my hair a lot, I refused to use a hairdryer out of principle (my mum keeps telling me that going outside with wet hair will give me a cold, so I’ve been doing it in even -5 Celsius just to prove her wrong – successfully, may I add), so I don’t think my hair was that damaged beforehand.

I just really hate how we’ve been tricked into believing that shampoos are this giant necessity and then we go through our entire adult lives forced to shell out money and contribute to waste to avoid having “dirty” hair. Even if the no poo thing doesn’t work out in the long run, I really hope never to go back to washing my hair more than twice a week, and definitely not every day!

tl; dr: Asian hair, no poo with hard water for 3 weeks, at first using green tea followed by black was fine, but it did nothing for my build-up and so I added lemon juice to the black tea and now my hair gets greasy very easily, albeit evenly so and at least without the nasty waxiness from hard water.

5204,t3_au3irp,"Hey. I'm about 9 days into WO (water only). I have very dense and thick wavy hair, about bob length, no color treatment.
My crown is pretty oily, but the rest of my hair is starting to feel very soft. I do get a little bit of static lift on the ends, however.
I brush in all directions, about 100 strokes every night. I have only washed twice thus far, both times soaking in a bath in the hopes that some of my flakes will float free, and then followed with a shower and COLD rinse to seal the cuticle.

A few questions:
1. I don't understand how to clean my boar bristle brush. It looks DISGUSTING after I brush; ashy and waxy.
2. I have a lot of flakes that will not come out of my hair. I ""scritch and preen"", but it just seems to make more. I cannot tell if it is dandruff or dry scalp because the flakies stick to my sticky, oily hair. How do I get rid of them?
I had this problem when I did regular washing before, and even when I shaved my head I still had flakes!
I have tried ACV rinse, and always felt as if it never came out of my hair completely. Like it was a layer or something.

5213,t3_assc8e,"Hey all, I've been basically shampoo free for about 9 years. I wanted to offer some thoughts and advice, because I have seen lots of posts by people just starting, or who have done it for a year or two, but not much from people like me, who've done it many years.

First, my qualifications. I first heard of the notion of not using shampoo a long time ago, and thought it made sense, so figured I'd try it. Worst case scenario it didn't work and I'd go back to shampooing every other shower. It did work, and I haven't stopped. I've had everything from shoulder length hair to buzz cut, so I have experience with varying lengths. 

I say I've been basically shampoo free, because I will still occasionally use shampoo. I do a lot of projects, woodworking, tinkering on my old lawn tractor, brickwork/masonry, and other messy hobbies. Every once in a while, my hair gets too dirty for just water, and I will use shampoo.  I have used shampoo probably no more than 4-6 times in the past 9 years. I am not opposed to using shampoo when it is needed, I just am not using it on a constant basis. 

My routine is straightforward.  I don't have extremely oily hair, which may be from not using shampoo for so long.  I generally shower every 2-4 days on average, depending on the weather and my activity level.  Summer I may shower every day, in winter when I'm not leaving the house, it may be 4-5 days. I know, that is along stretch to go between showers. I'm a stay-at-home dad of four young kids, and some weeks I don't do enough to warrant showering more often.  I smell myself before my wife does, and she tells me if she ever smells me. Don't judge...

Anyway, when I shower, usually in the evening, I get my head under the water and scrub my hair and scalp with my fingernails. I use my nails to exfoliate my scalp, and use my fingers to wash out anything that might have gotten in my hair. I'm not talking about scratching my scalp till it hurts or bleeds, just giving it a good scalp massage/scratch. 
When I get out, I towel dry, and will give it a quick comb if it's long enough. That's it. No egg yolks, mayo, yogurt, baking soda, vinegar, etc...

Now, I've seen a lot of posts saying their hair is 'oily', and I'm not really sure what the posters mean. When I run my hands through my hair, there will be a slight feeling of oil on my hands. That is normal. That is what hair does. It makes some oil to protect the hair shafts from drying out, and keep the hair healthy and voluminous. We want that oil, which is why we stop stripping our hair with shampoo.  

It is very similar to the coating of oil on a cast iron pan. If you are unfamiliar with this notion, it is like this. After using a cast iron pan, you want to put a thin coating of oil on the iron to protect the pan. Most people will pour a little oil in the pan, then use a paper towel to wipe out the excess oil. When finished, there are not pools of oil in the pan, just a nice, even, thin sheen. If you rub your palm across the pan, your palm will also have a thin coating of oil. Thin enough that you could probably just rub it in your hands like lotion and it would disappear. 

Similarly, if you run your hands through your hair, you will feel a small amount of natural oils on your fingers. To me it feel like that very last bit of lotion that gets trapped between your fingers, and you have to get your thumb or other fingers down at the base to get it out. That's what my hands feel like after running my fingers through my hair, and that is not 'oily hair' that is natural hair. 

I do not generally need hair products, gels, hair spray, or the like, because generally my hair is short enough I don't need it.  When I do need it though, I will use it.  I don't change my routine to get it out either.  I may spend just a few more minutes washing my hair to get it all out. Generally though, natural hair shouldn't be bothered by hair products, unless you are using them to excess. 

If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer as best I can. 

TLDR: I've been doing this a long time, you (frankly) probably don't need many of the ""alternatives"" that are pushed, and some oil in your hair is normal and nothing to be worried about. ",NoPoo
5214,t3_asrhir,"I went no 'poo a few years ago, in my late 20s, and immediately jumped straight to the bs/acv method. This worked for a couple years and then my hair went...bleh. I've always had very long hair (sometimes I can sit on it, though now I keep it more waist-length), average thickness (my braid is not quite as wide as my wrist, if that helps) and very soft. But with the baking soda once a week and boar bristle brushing every night, it wound up impossibly dry and unmanageable right after washing, passable the next day and downhill greasy the rest of the week. Even coconut oil wasn't helping. 

I switched back to shampoo, using sulfate-free ones with 'cone-free conditioners. I've tried several times in all this to go water only, the usual method being to gradually top the shampoo bottle with water. This always works great until I've used up the very last of the suds, then no amount of standing under the water and scrubbing and brushing does anything. My hair takes hours to dry on its own, anyway, and I usually give up and hit it with the blowdryer just to confirm what I already knew: the hard water left it greasy and waxy. On the rare occasions I've been somewhere with soft water, like on vacation, I've had the same grease problem without the wax. I'm currently using Carol's Daughter, which is price-y, but the results are great. 

I still follow my conditioner up with a rinse made of ACV and distilled water to remove buildup, but can't go more than 3 days without washing. I've also tried WO with ACV and still had the greasy problem. 

Now, I'm a full-time, stay-at-home aunt (for a sister who works at a daycare she can't afford), and I've been using my toddler niece and nephew for hair experiments since I'm invariably the one available at bath time. Previously, they'd both been using a hypoallergenic sulfate shampoo twice a week and a bit of my 'cone free vo5 conditioner, but one day I decided to go water only. 

Results: Niece, age 4, who has very fine shoulder-length hair with a slight wave, is able to up to a week without even rinsing, and it still doesn't look greasy. ACV, however, leaves it a bit limp. 

Nephew, age 2, extremely thick curly hair that hangs to his shoulders when wet is also able to go a week between rinses, ACV once a month helps combat any small amount of buildup that might be hiding in there and keeps his scalp smelling fresh. 

Again, we have hard water but neither of them are having any problem staying clean. Is this just an age thing because I started it so early on them and it's just too late for me, or is there some other trick I haven't tried?

I have been reading a lot if posts about dandruff/flakes/dry and itchy scalp/ Seborrheic dermatitis and even hearing IRL from friends and family. I decided to make this post so it could help others too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I was diagnosed with  Seborrheic dermatitis 4-5 years ago and it was BAD! I tried everything - prescription strength shampoo, drugstore shampoo, natural remedies like ACV, lemon juice etc, monistat anti-fungal cream, 8-9 kinds of oils, washing hair daily, washing hair weekly, shampoo bars etc. You get get the idea. 90% of these remedies did nothing, the other 10% worked but either left my hair as dry as a straw or stopped working after a few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I was utterly desperate and mentioned my problem to my massage therapist in Jan 2018. I have TMJ and get medical massage for head/neck/jaw area and I was super embarrassed to go to my therapist and have her rub her hands all over my nasty scalp. I told her about my problem and requested that she use gloves. She then mentioned that she studied Rosemary in her natural healing class and people swore by it.

 Being desperate, I tried it as instructed by her and voila! It worked! Instructions below.

1. Buy dried rosemary (online or whole foods).
2. Bring 3 cups of filtered water to a boil.
3. Add 2-3 tsp rosemary, preferably in a teabag/stainless steel tea ball thingy and reduce to the heat to a simmer.
4. Simmer the tea/rinse for 20-30 min.
5. Turn off the stove and let the rosemary steep, covered, for a few hours (optional for max efficacy).
6. Remove the rosemary and transfer the liquid to a spray bottle for easy application. Please use an amber/dark blue glass bottle (cheap on Amazon) to safely store the volatile oils/compounds in the rinse.

How to use: Use it all the time until you get rid of the flakes.

1. I use as a pre-wash treatment - spray all over scalp and hair liberally. It should saturate the scalp especially. I wait 30-60 min or even overnight depending oh how well I plan my day.
2. I also use it as a post-wash rinse - pour the rinse all over the hair in the shower post-wash as the final step. Rinse with water.
3. I also use it as leave-in - spray the scalp liberally and lightly on the hair after you get out of the shower on damp hair.
4. I use as needed on dry hair if I feel itchy. Simply spray on scalp and leave in.

FYI - I double the recipe and store in the fridge with a couple spoons of vodka in the rinse as a mild preservative. It usually keeps for 2 weeks.

I have been doing this for a year and my scalp is so healthy and flake-free. I did a very intensive daily treatment for 2 weeks to get my scalp under control and now I am at maintenance - usually a weekly application. The other great thing is the side-effects have been all positive - less frizz, skin looks fab because I usually also spritz my face with it. 

I bought a large 1 LB bag of organic Rosemary from Mountain Rose Herbs a year ago (no affiliation) and I still have a ton left. I am thrilled. This solution is so cheap, easy and safe. 

Variations: After telling everyone about this, my friends and family have reported back with their own recipes and all of them have worked well. See below:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Using fresh rosemary also works great. My friend lives in a warm climate and grows rosemary all year round in her yard. 
2. Not simmering or steeping - my cousin lives in a dorm at college and doesn't have a stove to do this. She simply microwaves water in large mug, adds the rosemary and tosses the tea bag 10-15 min later. She doesn't transfer it to a bottle either, she just dumps the entire mug on her head in the shower. 
3. The quantity is very forgiving - some use less/more. Still works.

Anyway, I hope this helps someone. Buy a small packet and try it. As mentioned above, I got a proper diagnosis for SD from a dermatologist, who funnily enough, laughed at this cure when I asked her before trying. Oh well, just happy it worked for me.

5237,t3_aoydry,"### My routine:
I use water only, cold when I'm in a place with hard water and hot when I'm somewhere with soft water (or somewhere with hard water that doesn't cause hair problems – more on this below). I scrub my hair and scalp pretty vigorously for a few minutes, as if I were using shampoo. I wash my hair like this every day. I don't use a brush or comb at all. My hair is short (&lt;1-5""). I've been doing water-only for about 4 years.

I eased into water-only by slowing using more and more ""natural"" hair products over the course of a few years. So I used normal shampoo -&gt; natural shampoo -&gt; baking soda -&gt; water only + occasional shampoo/baking soda to deal with hard water -&gt; water only. I never had a transition phase.

### Hard water
Hard water contains various, depending on region, dissolved minerals. The dissolved minerals bind to sebum to make really unpleasant sticky, white, waxy buildup. It can make your hair feel and look stiff and wet. It's not clear which minerals cause these problems (although my best guess is calcium). I've lived in various places with hard water and only some of them caused the stiffness/stickiness problem.

You should be able to look up your water hardness online. Your water utility [US] is required to make water testing data available, which includes info about dissolved mineral content. There are also maps that highlight regions with soft/hard water. However, keep in mind that the cutoff for hard water is subjective. The real measure of water hardness is if your water is causing you any hair problems. If you're rinsing/washing with water only and your hair starts to develop sticky white stuff, then you have hard-enough water.

I've found that this can be alleviated (amazingly!) by washing exclusively with cold water. It really does work :) When I switched to using cold water, my waxy buildup problems went away in a week of washing every day, so, 7 washes. So you should be able to tell in a short period of time whether cold water is working for you.

Sebum melts around 91°F (33°C). I hypothesize that when it melts the dissolved minerals in hard water get trapped and make that sticky white residue. Hence, if you wash with water cooler than 91°F, your sebum won't soften and won't get minerals mixed in with it.

### What you should do
First, see if you actually have this buildup problem with water-only. Like I said above, in my experience there are a lot of places with supposedly hard water that don't cause problems for me (maybe due to high dissolved minerals, but low dissolved calcium?).

If you *do* have buildup problems, you can address it in various ways:

* Wash with cold water.
* Wash with rain water.
* Wash with distilled water, not tap water.
* Use a shampoo or shampoo alternative every once in a while (every 2 weeks-2 months) to take out the mineral buildup, and do water-only for your day-to-day washes.
* Rinse with something acidic (vinegar is popular, lemon juice and citric acid should both work too). (I haven't tried this myself, but some people say it works.)
* Get a water softener system or water-softening shower head (some contain vitamin C that you have to replenish every so often). (I haven't tried this myself, but some people say it works. I've also seen some websites claim that shower heads can't soften water – they don't have enough contact time with it, basically.)

Lastly, if you're just starting off, I wouldn't worry about this stuff right now. Getting through the transition phase is the first struggle. Once that's done, if you're still having hair problems (dandruff, buildup, dryness, etc etc), look into different shampoo alternatives/changes to your routine to address those specific problems. I didn't even realize hard water was a problem until 1.5 years into low 'poo.",NoPoo

5239,t3_aojhcf,"One month in, no shampooing!

Okay backstory: my hair was falling at an alarming rate after shampooing. I had an itchy, scratchy scalp. Insane dandruff! Insane!
I was trying all sorts of oils and shampoos but nothing worked either for the itch/dandruff or for the hairfall. Then i found out about how shampoos rob our scalp of natural oils.

January 8th was the last time i oiled/shampooed my hair.

Now many here are doing only water which i dont think is right. Just Water cant remove grime. I wash my hair two or three times a week. Once with just water. Once an egg mask. I apply 2-3 egg yolks on my scalp and keep for half an hour. Then i rinse with cold water. I also do a yogurt mask once a week. (I told this to someone here earlier and he thought it was a joke, but it’s not.) Hung curd is basically plain yogurt drained of all water. You dont want to apply yogurt without draining the water else it would keep dripping all over your face. You can use a muslin cloth to do that. Apply for 30, wash with cold. Hair feels amazing. Of course, you gotta use plain yogurt not black fucking currant.

Now because of all these organic applications your head might smell a bit so take half a lemon, squeeze it in a bowl and once you’ve rinsed off the mask apply that lemon juice on your scalp. Keep it for a minute and then wash with cold. Think of it like a conditioner. Another great conditioner is onion juice. Will remove any smells and helps with dandruff too. Plus the sulfur in it is supposed to encourage hair growth.

My hairfall has reduced significantly. I’m no longer scratching my head like an idiot. The dandruff is still there but i would say it has gone down by half, at least. One last thing, switch to a wooden comb. Plastic combs generate static while brushing and our hair stick to the teeth and break away. No such problem with wooden combs.",NoPoo

1.	Brush your hair every morning and night and just before a shower. NEVER brush your hair when it's wet!

My dry scalp has been awful for a long time, and the dry environment I live in doesn't help. Exfoliating hasn't helped much, and I found most exfoliants needed to be shampooed out so I couldn't use them often anyway. I noticed my scalp behaved better after hair masks so figured adding moisture would be a good idea. I finally decided to try making a small spray bottle with a blend of:

* some fresh aloe gel (none of the yellow juice from the peel, just the clear gel from inside, and I used a leaf's worth so about 2tbsp but I'm going to start buying a pure gel so I don't kill my plant lol, recommendations welcome)
* good, clean witch hazel (a couple ounces or so)
* a bit of water (probably 3 ounces ish)

The exact proportions don't seem to matter much, for my personal results anyway.

After each wash but before applying leave-in conditioners/serums, I shake up the spray, divide my hair, and drench the hell out of my roots/scalp with it, then massage it in a bit. The very first time I used it, it did wonders for my dry scalp starting INSTANTLY! I also realized quickly that it seems to help control oil production, too, and I went from needing to co-wash about three times a week to only needing to do it once a week. That also happened essentially instantly!

I also started spraying it on (more lightly though, sometimes just on the really itchy/flaky areas) every day on dry hair, not just after washes. So far, I have never yet hit a point where this mixture dried heavily or left residue on my head, and I've put on a LOT of it at a time/over days. I have very fine strands, a fair bit of volume but the strands are super fine and get weighed down easily, so I think if this is drying down clean/weightless on me (especially going a week of uses at a time!) then it should probably do so on just about everyone.

I've been using this for about a month now. My dry scalp isn't totally gone but it's radically better than it was, the itching is a million times better, and the oil control benefit has stayed steady. One time when I didn't have aloe I just used the witch hazel, and the oil production stayed low but the flakes were more present; another time I didn't have witch hazel and just used the aloe, and that time the flakes were better but the oil production moved a bit more toward my-old-normal that week. Take from that anecdotal evidence what you will, and invent something that's perfect for you!

I'm really amazed by how easy this is, how well it works, and how cheap it is, and I really wish I'd tried it years ago. I reallyreallyreally hope this idea helps people out there. As far as I'm concerned, this tool should be in everyone's toolbox!",NoPoo

My hair is very fine, and straight. I am white. No dandruff while using shampoo.

* 27 days without touching a shampoo bottle, aaauuugggh. Since then I've been WO, and keeping my hair up in a ponytail on oily days. Which is most of the time.
* Scalp is still in oily phase but seems to have started producing less of it on its own. I'm not sure if I'm imagining it, or if I'm just used to the oiliness by now.
* Scritching **definitely** produces less oil from about two weeks in. First time I scritched, my hair went from completely clean to soaked and gross in less than a minute. Now it doesn't overreact any more.
* I kept thinking I wasn't distributing the oils down to my ends because my ends always felt dry, but after brushing charcoal residue through my hair that one time (to try reduce odor) and finding it completely soaking the brush it became pretty clear that yes, the oils really *do* stick to the brush very easily, and should therefore be sticking to my ends too.
* A week later I discovered ""hair dusting"", a method to reduce split ends without losing length. Found out that my ends aren't dry -- **the feeling of dryness came from split ends**. Dusting them significantly reduced the dry feeling.
* Been having odor problems for ten days. **It's definitely a bad smell.** So I've been WO washing my hair often the last week to try and keep it under control without resorting to charcoal, baking soda or shampoo -- at most I can only reduce it.
* Scalp started itching a week in, went down at about the three week mark.
* Had dandruff from about a week in -- it doesn't flake off the scalp when I scratch it, it's just there. When I see it I dig the BBB out.
* Today I found some tea tree oil spray at Coles so I sprayed my scalp and BBB, and had a good scritch and distributed it through my hair. Still slight smell, but a significant amount was reduced.
* Going to keep up the tea tree each day for the rest of the oily phase. Hopefully, the smell will go when the oily phase does... not looking forward to what I should do if it doesn't. I don't want to wind up having to measure out baking soda/ACV or eggs or whatever it is non-WO no-poo people do; seems to defeat the entire point of going WO if I'm dealing with a huge hassle like that. IDK, I'll cross that bridge when I come to it!
* **Hair is softer**. Like. Really soft. In the last week it's actually been pretty silky.
* **Volume is reduced**. My hair has always been very fine, and never had volume -- I've always relied on shampooing it, and having it dry in certain positions for volume. Without shampoo it's very flat and thin.
* I know I should be grossed out but I find it hilarious that on my oiliest days, I can take out my pony tail and the pony tail will just... stay. These are high ponytails, btw, not nape-of-the-neck ones. It just stays and I can even swish it around and it'll just hold, omfg. I have to actually tousle my hair to get it out.

&gt;  The method I use in that case, is I wash the ends only and then use a boar hair bristle brush and my hands to distribute the oil from my scalp down the shaft.

(Context at link)

Wanted to put this forward for more discussion.

The method I'd read about how to wash WO is:

* Scritch
* Preen
* BBB
* Wash hair under shower by scritching scalp under warm water

So basically -- still washing the scalp and getting rid of oils.

But like, has anybody done it /u/weeblewobble82's way -- not just to try and reduce the oiliness during the oily phase, but as a WO habit to maintain post-oily phase? Instead of washing the scalp?

It seems to make sense to me that it might be a better idea to just leave the scalp alone entirely outside of scritching, and to preen under water instead of scritching. But I don't know if that contributes to odor or oiliness or what.

&amp;#x200B;

Like the title says I'm going no poo for the first time in my life. I (18 M) have thick curly hair and Im looking for a healthier curl. I bought maneline's shampoo, and after using for half a week my hair started to become very thick and leathery. I understand the adjustment phase and I have noticed that it feels ""healthy"" however it has so much weight to it, when it dries its just a big bushy mess ( especially If I run my hands through it)

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to know for the other curly hair redditors what your routines are/ what products you reccomend to make a light and free flowing curl that holds its moisture. My hair is also dry as can be 8/10 dryness. I linked the shampoo for those that are curious.

&amp;#x200B;

recently I have tried using and egg yolk to clarify my hair, and that worked really well to make it feel very clean, however it almost feels the same as if I used a shampoo

Routine: I get in the shower ( always look warm) I wet my hair and use a soft tipped scalp brush to massage a small amount of maneline shampoo evenly throughout my hair. I let that sit for 2-3minutes and then gently rinse it out while running my hands through it. I then either air dry or use a pillow case to slowly rub my hair dry. more recently I used a yolk to rinse out build up in my hair.

Goals: solid routine to get defined curls with minimal frizz. Going for soft flowing hair as well.

TLDR: looking for a good routine to get free flowing curl that holds its moisture. what products or home remedies do you recommend?

Been no-poo consistently for about 7 years now, currently using African Black soap. So cheap, use it for my body and my hair, and it's wonderful. I make it softer with coconut oil or my beauty store mango styling gel that has jojoba oil and the like in it. 

I've got black, coarse Asian hair, so not sure how much my methods would help people, but I really just went cold turkey. One of the few good things from my mother was her getting me to go no-poo, hence why its been 7 years. Originally, I just used bar soap, and with my short hair it worked. 

Started using black african soap last year, it's really nice and exfoliating. Have to be causeful not to get too sudsy or else it really burns in my eyes. Coconut oil is super good for making my hair soft, but it definitely looks greasy right after I put it on.

The recipe starts with you mixing

° Rye Flour and Water

The ratio to mix it is 1:2 ( for every spoon of rye flour you add 2 spoons of water )

° Mix it fully until a liquid paste forms

° When washing leave it for a few minutes and then rinse until clean

° After that use Apple Cider to avoid dryness 

° At the end use a brush to remove any of the flour that is still on the hair

5290,t3_agwd6k,"I've always liked the idea, but am not convinced about the reality. I've been co-washing for a while and that's been working well, but would like to full on commit to water only.

However, I'm not convinced about the scientific basis of no poo. From what I've read, most proponents state that scalp starts producing less oil as it gets ""used"" to not being stripped of grease every few days. TBH, to me this sounds questionable (don't take this as an attack, I just think it's good  to challenge stuff). How would the skin cells and the hair follicle even monitor sebum levels?

**Is there any actual peer reviewed research into this, and where did the idea come from in the first place?**

Even if there's not and even if the above theory is wrong, that's less important than whether no poo works even for another reason.

Which brings me to question 2. All you people who have really nice hair from no poo; Is it actually ***nicer*** than when you used shampoo and conditioner, about the same, or worse but still fine? Because one of my friends has been ""no pooing"" for 6 years or so, and her hair looks fine. But it still sometimes looks a little waxy and greasy (especially now it's longer). So is your hair better than it was before? Or is no poo just a low maintenance way for hair to look OK.

Would super appreciate any insight!

Our plumbing in the house we are renting backs up if you look at it wrong, and the tub took a loooong time to drain out today.

To avoid shoving flour down our sensitive drain all the time, I was thinking about making some sort of tea. Like soak or cook the flour and use the liquid and not the solid. Do any of you do this? Cold soak or hot infusion? Do you put it on your head all watery or do you reduce it down to a thicker consistency? Do you feel it cleans as well as actual rye flour?

I feel like hot would get more of the good good out but my hair is loving the protein and I don't want to disturb the protein structures in the rye flour with heat. Also...would the water even have protein in it? I have doubts about it because of fake meat. Old school recipes for making seitan (a meat replacement) involve washing wheat flour in water. Repeated exposure to water removes any gluten until only the protein remains. Would this also be an issue? Like, would rye water be everything but the protein I want?

5322,t3_ad7uyy,"Hey NoPoo

I've been currently without soap about 3+ years now, using exclusively cold water on my hair for about a year. 

My guide to surviving the cold:
Start warm, but don't rinse your hair with hot water. ONLY use cold water in your hair. Warm water opens pores in your hair, allowing more adsorption of oils. Only using cold water will shock your hair, freeing oils more than usual. Water will get most of the oil out, and any excess should be taken up in a healthy amount once your hair warms up. When you scrub, rinse your hands often. NoPoo is a physical cleaning method and reducing oils on your hands makes it more effective. Use water as cold as you can go. It'll be rough at first, but if you stay consistent you'll get used to it. Cold showers are honestly very refreshing. 

As far as frequency, everyone is different. It will depend on your activity levels and experience with no shampoo. Pay attention to what you do each day and find what works. Personally, I will at least wet my hair daily but not necessarily scrub. 

If the cold is hard, start hot, alternate to cold when washing your hair, then back to warm before your toes fall off. But, ONLY cold water in your hair. Any amount of hot water can result in greasy hair at the end of your shower. 

Good luck, learn to love the cold. Cold showers are one of the best things I've found for energy, mental health, and immune system promotion.

Best,

- Juice from 1 lemon
- About a tsp Cinnamon

Place in a jar and let ferment on the counter for 1-2 days, then move to the fridge. After eating the apples, I dumped about a half cup of the 'brine' in my hair and worked it like shampoo.

What I came across recently is that some are doing the same thing with their entire body--which is, going soap-less.

How are you doing today?

So, I got some skin and hair problems ever since I can remember. When I was younger I didn't really care about hygien and it turns out that I grew up with a lot of pimples, blackheads and dandruff. 
This year when I decided to cut my long hair I realized that I was balding, and this process improved really fast through this year, it's terrifying. 
As you all probably know, commercial anti dandruff shampoos and skin care medicine didn't work at all. I went to the dermatologist and she said that I'm balding thanks to a condition called ""Dermatitis Seborrheic"", in other words my glands works too much, my body gets too oily and due to the lack of proper skin care it turns to be a really big problem. After researching I realised that it wasn't worth to take any of the tons medicine she asked me to buy and take - first because it's too expensive; second because they wouldn't solve the problem, just addict me (like anything in health industry nowadays). 
I decided to start taking cold showers and I am already used to it. I don't use any shampoos, but use conventional soaps to wash my body and head. After taking a shower, I apply apple cider vinegar and a tea of nettle, rosemary and cinnamon on my scalp and leave it. It works pretty good, my scalp isn't itching too much and no dandruff, but if I don't take a bath everyday the dandruff comes again and start itching a bit, but it isn't as bad as it used to be. 
I am trying a new diet, cutting the junk food as much as I can and taking vitamins and care more about nutrition. I also stated working out. 
PS: I'm just 18, that's why I am terrified.

Some background info: I have been low-poo for four years, using Dr. Organic Aloe Vera once a week. I have shoulder-length hair, straight and I would say it’s very healthy (no split ends and hardly ever dry).

I scritch, preen and BBB every day and keep my brush clean. I use microfibre cloth once a week. But my hair is still one greasy mess, from top to bottom.

I’ve been washing with baking soda and rinsing with ACV (mixed with water) about twice a week, and using Badger brand hair oil mixed with rose water as a leave-in conditioner, all for about six months. 

My problem is that my hair looks like garbage every morning after I sleep on it, and the only surefire way to make sure it looks nice every day is by FULLY rinsing or washing. This is true whether I air dry or blow dry. If I rinse and let air dry, I have wet hair for the first half of the day, which doesn’t work when I work mornings. It’s very easy for it to become frizzy after air drying. If I mist with a spray bottle after waking up, my hair ends up frizzy beyond acceptability whether or not I run my fingers through; like, I may as well not have bothered.

If I have blow dried it smooth the previous day, then I wake up to cow licks that I can’t smooth out, even with a boar bristle brush. The brush may flatten the cowlick, but the ends of my hair will stay wavy, creating an equally weird texture that I end up wanting to pin back; again, why bother trying if I’m just going to cover it up?

When I was a naive youth, I used to wash and blow dry my hair EVERY SINGLE DAY for this reason. It has always been a challenge to make my hair look nice from day to day, and I’m tired of constantly cutting it short. I miss having a bob/longer hair, so I’m growing it out again with the hope that I will be able to treat it better this time around and keep it nice looking, and also that I’ll at least be able to pull it into a bun on days when I don’t have time to fuss with it. Still, I just wanna be pretty some days! 

So, now that I have some length again...does anyone with a similar hair type have any suggestions for everyday styling for fine curls when daily rinsing is not an option?

I then rinsed thoroughly and then soaked with ACV and then rinsed again.

I was getting a lot of waxy build up, in retrospect I possibly should have rinsed with acv, but I was hoping it would work itself out.

I assume we don't have hard water because we have a whole house water softener but have never tested our water.  

My hair is thin and was 2C/3A with my old ways but has been much more straight since giving up conventional shampoo. (The exact opposite of what I had hoped for.)  

My current routine:  I wash with my shampoo bar, currently using ""Simply Shea"" by Apple Valley, and follow up with an ACV &amp; water rinse.  I've also started using about a dime size amount of conditioner in the ends of my hair along with an even smaller amount or Argan and Jojoba oils. On wash day my hair can have a lot of fly-aways and may even look frizzy.   Day 2 is hit or miss; sometimes my hair looks fine and other times my roots begin to look greasy.  By day 3 my roots are noticeably greasy.   Sometimes  I just braid it and deal, other times I use a homemade dry shampoo (corn starch and cocoa).   By day 4 I really struggle with whether to shampoo again or not. Sometimes the dry shampoo will get me 2 extra days, sometimes only 1 day.  I do notice that I can go a bit longer before my roots get greasy if I skip the ACV rinse.  I do have 2 boar bristle brushes that I've tried using.  It doesn't seem to make a huge difference and I'm not sure the oils are getting to the ends of my hair?  It's also been pretty rough on my curls.

I tried going water only but getting my hair wet seems to make it angry.  Even with lukewarm/cool-ish water it makes my roots immediately look more oily.

But both my shampoo and conditioner contain silicones and I fell into the bad habit of basically doing scritch and preen with both my shampoo and conditioner because I thought it would make my hair extra clean and extra moisturized, so I’m positive I’d experience bad results unless I clarified my hair. 

The only thing I’ve seen to clarify is a silicone free and sulfate containing shampoo and conditioner but I have neither, and I don’t want to go buy some if I don’t have to especially since they would both potentially never be used again. 

I do have Castile soap, if maybe some of that diluted with water would work, but I don’t have anything to condition after. I also have baking soda but no apple cider vinegar, but I have been meaning to buy some so if that’s a good option for clarifying maybe it’d be better to wait a few days until I’ve bought some.

Looking for help and completely sick of my hair becoming greasy halfway through one day. Now I have been Water Only for two weeks running with no real need to use cleansing products at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

To preface, my hair is fine with a slight wave, and there is a LOT of it. I shed like crazy and currently it sits roughly at the bottom of my rib cage.

I always had heaps of trouble with my hair, in high school it was greasy on top with dry and splitting ends. If I washed it in the morning it would 100% be greasy by lunch time. It was infuriating for me. After some time complaining about it, my sisters friend said if I didn't wash it for 3 weeks and then went back to washing it normally it would be HEAPS easier. I thought this was great - in theory. Obviously I knew nothing about sulfates and silicones so it didn't make any difference, just that it was insanely oily for the three week duration.

So I went back to normal for some time, just washing it and dealing with the greasy and oiliness that went along with it. Until one day in my 20's I discovered reddit and this sub. I was so surprised it was an actual thing for people, let alone a possibility for me to maybe get to a point where I wouldn't need to wash my hair so much, which seemed completely unfathomable.

Anyway, I did some research and lurking of this subreddit and of course my first go to was baking soda and vinegar, which absolutely no idea about pH levels I just went ahead and did it. My hair texture changed, it became really thin and straight, it looked great for a while, until the baking soda started burning my scalp. Naturally I flipped and made my way back here for other alternatives, I came across rye flour.

Let me just say, Rye Flour is amaaaaaaazing. So good for you like, once a week, great protein for your hair. But I think I just found for me, it was unsustainable considering the length of my hair. But by this point, sticking to rye flour and especially no longer touching silicone conditioners, the length of time to washing my hair was increasing, bit by bit.

I was really happy, my hair was growing so well and it was great, it honestly still is but as I said, the upkeep with rye flour, the husk and potential damage to my plumbing was concerning for me. So after a few months, I looked to sulfate and silicone free shampoos and conditioners.

In my country, it's not so easily accessible and when you do find it, it is EXPENSIVE. I first tried [this](https://moogoo.com.au/milk-shampoo.html) along with the matching conditioner, it worked well and my hair grew like crazy. After a while though my scalp was getting really dry. I had started to learn a bit more about ingredients in shampoo and conditioner and realised it is full of coconut derivatives, which I don't think my skin agrees very well with. So again, I looked for another alternative.

I then found [this shampoo](https://www.akin.com.au/sensitive--scalp/p/mild-and-gentle-fragrance-free-shampoo-225ml/1310001.html?lang=en_AU#lang=en_AU&amp;start=1). Which is pretty much what I have been using for the past year. It has been so great, even though it's expensive for me, I only use it roughly once a week. It doesn't foam up much, but you don't necessarily need it to. Because of my dry ends, the conditioner was perhaps not enough to help with the splitting, but I changed to the deep conditioner, which easily fixed the issue. Also conditioner only with this product worked really well to my surprise.

Anyway, recently I have been between my two jobs, I start a new one soon. But I got really lazy and didn't wash my hair with anything but water. It's been two weeks and it actually looks really good. The only thing I've recently changed is my hairbrush to one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Brush-Cushion-Bristle-Handle-Brushes/dp/B00898E5O2) which has helped immensely with my split ends.

Anyway, if you're curious to know what gross disgusting foul greasy after half a day hair looks like after literal years of trial and error, to today with two weeks WO, here it is. Remember kids, persistence is key.

I run a business, and I'm the only employee. The way I present myself will, of course, make or break the potential for a new client as we work one-on-one in a sort of alternative talk therapy.

I would LOVE to go no-poo and I plan on it! My only potential issue is, with type 2a blonde hair that's thick, porous, damaged, and 3 ft long, will the transition look TOO gross to represent my business to a shampoo-loving public?

I can't find many pictures of examples of hair like mine during the process of going no-poo, so I'd love to hear how many people here had serious grease and how many found it manageable!

I'm vegan so i wouldn't use eggs or honey during the process, and the water in my home is very soft. I would hope and pray to go water only, but I'm down for coconut oil conditioning as necessary... even if that's often!

5437,t3_9rlxr3,"I have thin hair. My usual routine is to shampoo my hair every other day, and cover it with dry shampoo on days when I don't wash my hair. I recently started using lush bars, which I loved, but then realized they have sulfates, and now I am not sure I want to use them. I also have a giant bottle of livingproof shampoo, which I like. I also normally use a detangler, volumizing spray, heat protector, sometimes I use hair wax, and finish it off with hair spray.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a large forehead, so it is not easy for me to wear my hair up, because my forehead looks giant! Same goes for headbands, etc. I work out a lot, so I don't want to bother with bangs. When I had bangs, I had to wash it every day, and it was thinning out even more, so I gave up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I washed my hair normally as described above on Monday. Then I wanted to go swimming on Wednesday evening, so I didn't want to wash my hair on Wednesday morning, as I would normally do, and instead I just wore it up. It is not normal for me, and I didn't feel good the whole day. 

&amp;#x200B;

On Wednesday night I ended up not going swimming, and instead was reading about this subreddit and checking out some FAQs.I didn't want to have a weird transitioning period, since I am already very concerned about my face and my hair, and having greasy hair is not something I am ok putting up with. 

I already have a boar-bristle brush, so I was wondering, what would happen if I just wash my hair with warm water only, and condition. I was like.. well.. the worst thing that can happen, I will have to wash it again the next day, but it's worth a try. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I washed my hair thoroughly, massaging very well, then applied a tiny bit of conditioner, and made sure I rinse it well. To my surprise, my hair felt very clean, I didn't feel the difference comparing to using shampoo. And if you don't feel the difference, then why use it? I was shocked with the results. I noticed my hair was more shiny, but not oily. I also skipped the detangler (surprisingly my hair didn't feel like straw, so I didn't see the need), skipped the volumizing spray, and everything else. I just dried my hair with a hairdryer, and it felt really good all day. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the evening I swapped my silk pillowcase around to make sure it is clean, and combed my hair with the boar-bristle brush. I went to sleep without braiding my hair (hoping for that magical effect of a silk pillowcase). I brushed my hair thoroughly with the brush, and went to work. This is the first time I went to work with my second-day hair free of any products. I can definitely see reduced volume compared to yesterday, and I am definitely slightly concerned that by the end of the day my hair is going to look oily, but I am hoping for the best. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I just want to share, and if you guys have any tips or comments, feel free.

I learned these are cyclic silicones (or siloxanes) based on a [Naturally Curly article](https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/curlchemist-cyclomethicones-a-different-category-of-silicones) which also includes some mixed messages about build-up, e.g., ""Cyclomethicones... aren't prone to build-up"" and ""[consumer-reported] problems were attributed to build-up on the surface or build-up due to penetration of the smaller silicone into the hair shaft,"" then the author suggests the unfavorable results were due to a different mechanism.  

[Neonatural.com](http://www.nenonatural.com/hair-blog/-water-soluble-vs-non-soluble-silicones-found-in-hair-products) indicates Cyclohexasiloxane is only slightly soluble and Cyclopentasiloxane is not water soluble, indicating these are both likely to contribute to buildup.

5485,t3_9k74rw,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very new to the whole ""no 'poo"" thing (a bit over a week in), so I'm still on my first method which is applying a mask of bentonite clay, ACV, lavender essential oil, and water (enough to form a paste), every three days or so, rinsing with a diluted ACV rinse, and brushing with a BBB the days between.  

&amp;#x200B;

The bentonite clay honestly almost seems too good to be true - it leaves my hair soft, de-tangled, and not overly greasy.  Has anyone else been doing this long term?  Are there any risks I should be aware of?  (Other than the fact that it can dry your hair out if you leave the mask on too long).  ",NoPoo
5486,t3_9jtl89,"I've been washing with water only for about 2 years. I heard about No Poo and without really doing any research just decided to stop using shampoo, conditioner or styling products in my hair. I do pretty much nothing to it except rinse it with hot water and towel dry it into a rough messy style. I've always kept my hair pretty short and this process has served me well. However, I've grown it a bit longer now (apparently having newborn twins doesn't leave much time for things like haircuts), and instead of just lopping most of it off, I want an actual hairstyle. If you Google ""male haircut short sides long top"", pretty much any of the image results are what I'd be aiming for.

My problem is that when my hair is a bit longer, it gets kind of fluffy, voluminous and difficult to control. It doesn't *feel* too dry, but it kind of looks it, I guess. I think my individual hairs are quite fine and wiry, I just have a lot of them, if that makes sense. My hair's not curly, but once it gets a bit longer it's also definitely not straight by any measure.

What can I do to tame it into my desired style? I've loved the feeling of not having any wax or gel in my hair and am reluctant to go back to using some kind of styling product, although I'm open to recommendations if that's the way I have to go.

I had been attempting NoPoo for several years with mixed results in the quality of my hair. I'm also quite active and regularly workout and also work in a hospital and am likely colonized by MRSA. 

During this time I developed a true chronic folliculitis in my beard (NOT (pseudo)follicitis barbae). For years I took intermittent and then suppressive doxycycline with some suppression of the follicitis, but never a remission. Retrospectively the time correlation between NoPoo and development of the folliculitis seems pretty clear, but at the time I couldn't attribute a clear cause. I do have a history of acne (requiring accutane) and changing my pillow cases daily seemed a bit helpful but was unsustainable. Ultimately I tried daily shampooing with strong salisylic acid shampoo and have been folliculitis free for months for the first time in YEARS. 

Let this be a cautionary tale that if you are prone to development of comedones (acne) and are likely colonized with MRSA via healthcare work or high-level physical activity/gym going, then NoPoo may result in chronic skin issues.

The hairdresser washed it and holy cow, did it feel nice, smooth, light and just so clean afterwards. I kept playing with my hair the whole day, it was just so nice.

I tried the distilled water and acv today and WOW my scalp feels great, my hair isn’t greasy, and it has volume! Worlds a difference from the greaseball lumpy tangly mess I had when I tried shampoo bars before.

I did more research and found out that hard water leaves build up in your hair which can make your hair feel disgusting. It also doesn’t rinse out. It basically adds chlorine and a load of other crud to you hair. Plus it can cause dandruff, itchy scalp, and eczema. So I’m investing in a $30 water softener shower filter. (Not just a shower filter, it needs to actually soften the water).

Look on YouTube on how to test if you have hard or soft water. This can be done with castille soap/dr bronners and a cup of your shower water. I’m sure there are other methods. Such as just trying out a rinse with distilled bottled water and apple cider vinegar and not washing it out after you rinse.

I've started using micellar water from Garnier occasionally on my face and reading a post from a few months ago I thought I'd see what happened if I used it on my hair.  I used the same amount as I normally use for my clay shampoo, about 1/3 c. and scrubbed it into my scalp.  Immediately I could tell that it was cleaning it really well, perhaps too well.  The water started to get kind of milky colored as it grabbed all the sebum.  I then rinsed it all out and used my normal conditioner so the only thing that changed in my routine was the cleanser.

Results: Not a huge fan. My hair got really tangled after using it and felt way too squeaky clean, this was almost like a sulfate wash.  I would only use this vary rarely as a clarifier.  If however you have a different style hair maybe this would work, or perhaps it could be diluted to give better results.

So i went to the dr. And he suggested to use Tgel theorputic shampoo....Buuuut it had SLS in it. I dont want to use this.. im supposed to use it 3 times a week. I fear SLS will dry my scalp more and also the damage to aquatic life that SLS does is a big no no. 

I heard moo goo scalp cream is good. I bought that yesterday.. buuut i dont know if it will work.

At the start of my dry face scalp fiasco i used some goat mousteriser and while it helped the day of applications i always woke up with it worse.

Any suggestions guys? 

Oh and previously my skin was very tollerable.  It wasnt too dry or too oily. And i never wear make up excpet maybe like once every 6 months or so.

5548,t3_9bscja,"Hi all.
I've not been able to try out NoPoo as consistently as I would like to. I spent much of the last 3 years with bleached blonde hair. Naturally, my hair is a mid brown, so you can imagine the state it was in. 
About 2 months ago, I decided to stop bleaching, and had my hair dresser put a brown on to cover most of the blonde. I'm planning to not dye or bleach - hopefully never again!
My hair is quite thick, and prone to breakage. My hairdresser told me that moisture is actually the worst thing for bleached hair! Bleach strips the protein out of hair, and adding moisture makes it very weak.
I discovered the power of the natural hair mask today. I mixed up an egg, coconut oil, honey, and a little cocoa powder (to help fight the fade!). I slathered it on, and left it overnight. I've washed it out with a low-poo (no Parabens or SLS). My hair is still drying - but my god it's beautiful.
I've also learned that I should not be using baking soda on my hair right now, because it's pretty good at ripping the dye out!
I hope my little experiment can be helpful to someone. 
I can't wait to try another protein loaded mask in a couple of weeks.

2. **Will the barber notice?** At some point I'd go to a barber to get an haircut, should I use a shampoo in that case? Also I'd like to show some respect and not go there with smelly/greasy hair or hair that is difficult to handle (since it's he that have to work and touch them, being a person that doesn't really like touching other people's hair I may understand his possible concern) 

3. **What about gel and hair wax?** Are those two good or no good? Not actually using them, but if I ever had to I'd like to know if they will ruin my work

4. **What about the rest of the body?** Since it's still using bath product on the skin, would it be better to stop using them also? I would try and stop using anything on my body (except for toothpaste), but also there I'm afraid about the body odour, as respect for people around me

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to start my cowashing journey.  I have super fine and thin straight hair.  I've recently had some pretty bad breakage from bleaching, so I'm doing a drastic 180 and putting natural haircare at the top of my list.  I've trimmed off what I can of the breakage and am not going to bleach again.  From what I've read at /r/FancyFollicles basically my only option is to cut off the dead and wait for it to grow out. 

&amp;#x200B;

With so much information out there, I've found a ton of different techniques and conditioners to use.  Right now I'm using Suave Essentials (in a strawberry sent).  I thought that was a safe option but from my research it seems they've changed the ingredients and only the coconut ""flavor"" is the co-wash/no poo approved variety.  **Can I use the rest of this bottle? Or am I better off just going and getting a new bottle?**

&amp;#x200B;

I've read a ton about how you wash on wash day.  What no one really covers is **What does the week look like? Do you cowash everyday? Every 3-4 days?  Do you apply leave in conditioners? If so, do you do that everyday? How does that look?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Most importantly, I work out a lot-- and because of my thin/fine hair sweat basically saturates my entire head.  Due to my breakage I've been just allowing my hair to air dry after exercise (because I've sworn off any hot tools unless I'm going to a formal event or something).  **Will this method work when cowashing? How do I approach sweaty gym hair?** Do I let it dry and then try to comb through any oils? 

Finally, Do you do any additional oils in your hair, maybe at night between washes? **Show me your typical routine for cowashing!**

So last November I decided to finally make the jump and go no-poo. It was something I had been interested in trying for a couple of years but never had the courage to actually do. Here is my story (yea I know I wrote a novel) and my experience, and I hope it helps give a little hope to people just starting out who are struggling.

Starting out, my transition to no-poo was born out of circumstance more than anything. Last fall I made the decision to set up a camp out in the woods on the edge of town and make it my home. I had a rudimentary shower rig but washing up still only happened a couple times a week at most, so I used a BBB in between ""showers"" to try and tame the grease. 

After a month or so had passed and winter was getting close, I decided it was time to return to society so I got an apartment. I decided that even though I was easily able to shower every day, I wanted to keep going down the no-poo road. I researched a little more about Water-Only routines and developed one for myself. 

Every day before I showered and before I went to bed I would scritch my hair really thoroughly and go through it with my BBB. In the shower, I would scritch again while making sure the water was hitting my scalp directly where I was scritching, and move my hair around to help the water rinse out all the dirt and oil. For drying I would simply dab my hair with my towel to get some of the water out and then let it do it's thing. 

It took about 3 months for me to go through the ""transition"" phase until I no longer looked like Kurt Cobain, and now my hair is the healthiest and best-looking it has ever been. It is soo soft and shiny now, and the color even slightly changed! I have always had dirty blonde hair, but before going WO it was more light brown. Now it is waay more blonde and people have noticed. Starting out was pretty tough and I had plenty of moments where I was ready to give up, but now I wouldn't even dream of putting ANYTHING in my hair besides water. 

If you're just starting out and are stuck in the horribly waxy transition, keep going you can do it! The pay-off is definitely definitely worth it. ",NoPoo

It's also always been greasy and I still have to wash it every day. For a while I could do every other day, but it's back to daily again. I'm not sure what's going on.

I have extremely thin and 'dead' hair. It looks a lot better since ditching shampoo so I won't go back. I just need to change things up.

What would be a good direction to go in? I worry co washing will make my hair look greasy and flat (I avoided conditioner previously as it made my hair that much more flat and lifeless - don't know if it would be any different now?). I'm off put by the baking powder and ACV stuff as I tried it before and it just seems cumbersome and ineffective. I don't mind making my own concoction, but only if I can make a bottle and not need too much effort every day, like cracking open an egg or whatever. If I only had to wash my hair once a week it would be another story. But I need to be able to wash it quickly without too much hassle every day.

My goal is to have healthier hair and be able to wash it less. I'll settle for healthier though. It's getting irritatingly dry!

I read years ago that the straighter and longer your hair is, the harder it is to ditch shampoo. So I'm happy I've managed to at all. But I would *love* to not have it get greasy every day and to wash it less often. I can try another 'transition' period, I just don't trust I'll get results. I'm not sure what to try.

Any suggestions or advice? 

Thank you.

5587,t3_97cb6a,"I've been nopoo and nosoap for a week now. My hair used to puff out and I'd get frizzy flyaways no matter what so I went cold turkey to water only and it calmed down the frizz for sure. I washed once with diluted baking soda but I didn't have any acv on hand so no rinse. It didn't really seem to ""work"" though. It was hard to get my hair totally rinsed and I didn't notice any real difference. I used some older baking soda so maybe that's why?

Anyway my real question. 

I have allergies to smoke and work in a smoky environment. So when I'm at work the smoke kinda gets stuck in my hair and just lingers. I used to just shampoo it out and notice an immediate improvement in my sinuses. Obviously I won't be using shampoo anymore and the baking soda didn't help much, what should I try next? Or will this just resolve itself as my hair and scalp adjust from 30 years of shampoo to no poo.

I'm thinking I'll buy new baking soda, and use the acv rinse after. If that doesn't work, I'll try rye flour. I just want clean hair without poo!! Any suggestions?? ",NoPoo

Before that, I had been shampooing and conditioning my hair on an almost daily basis and using some texturizing product to style my hair. I'd heard about some people cutting out shampoo and conditioner and thought I may give it a try and honestly, I'm kinda liking the results so far. I'm a guy with thick straight hair so I had been a little skeptical at first since I remember being younger and always having my hair fall flat on my face if I didn't use any products. But I'm 4 days in so far and my hair feels very full and is keeping shape when I comb it into a side part. I did go swimming in a chlorinated pool today though and I think that may have stripped some of the oils from my hair but it still feels good.

Even with lots of BB, scritching, preening, and applying oil after washing, sometimes I still found my ends would still get dry and fuzzy after a while.

I keep it in a small spray bottle and apply when needed. No need to wash out, sort of like a leave in conditioner. I went for an approximate ratio of one tablespoon of aloe gel from the leaf, and 2 tablespoons of water.

My body isn't itchy and scratchy anymore, but that's where I've had the more major complaints. And I know it myself too, my armpits reek in 1 month of no soap.

I'm theorizing that just after shower I've killed off (with rubbing and tap water chlorine) most of my bacteria, so the actinobacteria take over again with their smelly outputs.  But I might be mighty wrong and more rubbing is what's needed.

Right now, I shampoo every other week followed by an ACV rinse and coconut oil in my ends (trying to use up the shampoo I have before I start making my own--unsurprisingly, this is taking forever).  Around the one-week mark, I'm using dry shampoo (corn starch, cocoa powder, EO), qnd my hair honestly looks better after dry shampoo than it does after an actual wash.  I usually wash my hair with cold water in the mornings, though after dry shampoo I don't because it tends to make my hair look greasier.  My hair is a couple of inches past my shoulders, but I also have the sideswept bangs/emo flap thing going on.  As my hair's been getting longer, I can tell that the natural oils have been doing really good things for it.

The bangs/around my scalp is where the greasiness is really noticeable (*especially* the bangs, though).  I usually just clip my hair back to get through this, but the oils in my hair seem to have a certain smell, and it's not pleasant.  The dry shampoo helps some, between the cocoa smell and the EOs I use, but it's just a smell on top of a smell.

So, I already stopped using conditioner for a while now and wash my hair with shampoo twice or three times a week. I haven't seen such and awesome improvment worth mentioning so I started thinking about going with no shampoo at all. But I got very confused when reading about it.

However, when I saw videos about it, from people who are part of the moviment for a while, I noticed that they only used water, so, who should I listen, any personal experiences?

I tried explaining that by washing my hair less frequently will make it healthy and that it won’t look this oily next week or so, that there are plenty of people who do the same and a lot of info online but they just won’t listen to me. Did any of you went through criticism while doing the no poo method? How did you deal with it? Our society is so fucked up that I honestly wouldn’t feel great about feeling people that I don’t use shampoo. Is it just me? Please advise! Thanks :) :)",NoPoo

I'm having some doubts about this No poo.. well. no.. having doubts about No conditior and need some help.  


I've tried looking at the FAQ and pinned post stuff but on my desk top i can't see the community info.. it's only on my phone and it's really hard to see and go to all the links.  
my hair history.  
 i live in Australia, I have type 2ish hair. but it's super thick. super greek and below shoulder legnth.  
For my life I have only needed to wash my hair once a week or once a fortnight sometimes.  
my hair never gets oily, the only reason i'd actually wash is that after about a week it would get itchy and gunky.  
I am ( was) an avid user of products, due to my hair not being naturally oily i would use a lot of leave in conditioners and oils. it would jsut soak it up, but my hair wasn't ever really dry either except the ends... my hair is in "" good"" condition apart from having all these chemicals in it.  


 recently, I mistakenly have done two washes ( 1 each week) with bi carb prior to doing a last sulphate wash to get rid of the silicones. and used AVC.  the first week was amazing. my scalp never felt so clean, but by the second week my hair was getting very knotty and kinda... elastic? when i'd brush it would spring/stretch/pull and then break. it didn't feel.. like.. good.  
wash ratios i used  was 1 and half TBS bi carb and 2 Cup water.  
ACV 20ml to 320ml water  
last night i did a massive coconut oil left it in untill tonight where i have done my last sulphate wash.  
I rinsed with AVC ( i hope that is okay)  


I am mostly confused about the no conditioner part. I understand that ACV is supposed to replace that part?  
Also what is a replacement for a leave in conditioner? a lot of suggestions are oils.. but that makes my hair look oily?as each time i used oils for the past 2 weeks it made my hair more oily than it used to.   
the oils i used was coconut and teatree ( teatree on account of dandruft)  


am I to just trust that i wont need any conditioner or treatment after a shower eventually?also sometimes i straighten my hair, but i suppose i will have to give up a heat protectant? is there an alternative? will i need to do that anymore considering my hair ""should"" be getting healthier and stronger?  


okay, thats it i think. sorry guys.. and thank you.

I'm a 26 y/o white guy, I think my hair is 2A but I'm not entirely confident on that.  It's basically short, thick hair with a slight wave.  Since ditching shampoo I no longer have to use styling product to get my hair to not look like a giant mop on my head, now I only use a little bit if I really want to make sure I have 100% control of it.

My question is that my sister just bought me this dope comb for my birthday which I have been using w/ my BBB.  

[the comb in question ](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/schwarz-manufacturing-co-brass-comb) is made of brass, which is a big part of what makes it so cool but I was just wondering the other day if it has the potential to damage my hair more than a plastic or wooden comb.  My hair is really thick and it always has at least a knot or two which I have to use a bit of force to get through, and I'm a little bit worried the sharper metal teeth could do some harm if I force it through my hair.

Anyhow, over the weekend I had some time off, so I though I'd do a full hair treatment. Started off with one week greasy hair (this would be the time I usually wash it).

I first did a milk and honey mask. Melted three teaspoons of honey into a cup or two of full fat milk, soaked my towel dried hair with the mixture focusing on the ends. Let it sit for close on an hour, then rinsed it out with water only.

Had some castor oil laying around, and put some on the most damaged sections of my hair while still damp. Let it sit for a day.

Did a egg yolk mask/wash (as I will do anytime I really need to clean the hair like now due to the oil), and put a small amount of a Lush massage bar (mainly cocoa and shea butter) on the ends as a conditioner.

My hair is the softest and nicest it has been in such a long time! The shine is crazy, and not oily or waxy at all. I think my hair was just dying for some moisture.

Try this if your hair feels a bit dry and unmanageable. I will def incorporate milk and honey masks more frequently.

Sorry for the poor picture qualities :/

Hair description:

My hair is brown/reddish, thin, mid-long, and I usually dye it once a month with supermarket dye shampoos to cover some whites. 


Perspective:

I believe this is the ideal moment for me to transition, since I'm going on holiday (no stress about greasy hair in the office) and I'll spend my third transition week at the seaside (potentially a lot of sea water + normal water washes).


Questions:

1. About NoPoo products:

I don't want to use anything but water (and comb/brush). No rye flour, no baking soda, etc. Is this realistic? 


2. About washing or not washing:

I've already started by not washing my hair for 4 days (I usually wash it every other day or max every 3 days). Today it's greasy. Should I wash it with water already or waiting is better? 


3. About hair dye:

My hair always looked greasy at the top and dried out in the lengths. It didn't bother me that much because I usually put it up in a braid. But I also lose much more hair than before.

It doesn’t get too much oily, but lot of volume and a bit dry (because of the sea salt that I just wash out with water).

Now my last wash with shampoo was 3 days ago. Today I washed my hair with one organic egg (yellow + white), I put some essential oils in it and rinced out with lots of water. I finished with AVC. My hair is really soft, bouncy and feels clean. No greasiness ! 

I hope you can see the photos ! Any question welcome and sorry for my english 😉.

Ever since I was a teenager whenever I washed my hair, From then on to the second day with just water, it would ALWAYS be waxy as hell.

I even tried no shampoo for a few months with only water and the wax built al the way down to my hair tips and would not go away, apple cider vinegar never did anything.

I ended up using shampoo but avoiding water on my second day since then.
But it was still crap and would be oily within hours of washing and just get worse and not stop.

So recently I’ve been trying to look up better methods for getting rid of oily hair because I started wetting my hair on the second day again and it looks terrible like it always did and is hella waxy at the top of the head.

I’ve only been washing my hair with this https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/325785/organic-care-kids-hair-care-3-in-1-fruit-blast every second day and not touching my hair roots or scalp with anything, because the so-called natural shampoo bars have more dangerous ingredients than normal shampoo, I just don’t touch the roots or scalp, but I got skin flaking off even though I scrub my scalp with water in the shower.

My hair is always crap when I wet it without washing it.

I was wondering if I could brush all purpose flour or other powders or something through my dry hair and not have to wet my hair and it could get rid of the oil or something? I’ve never tried stuff like this before btw. I don’t wanna use exotic hipster ingredients.

This is my first post here and I didn't knew that this community existed in reddit. I heard about no poo when I googled my questions out of curiosity about not using shampoo. 

I have been on it for 40 days. There was dandruff and all in the beginning but everything was fine. 

One problem I had was that my hair gets all tangled up like messy and all if I don't use oil. I usually use coconut hair oil.  Like I can't comb my hair unless I use oil. I wanted to know if this is something I should be concerned about. 

I would love to hear your thoughts on this. ",NoPoo
5713,t3_8t3w5g,"Hi all, I'm 21 year old male hair with medium length, wavy/curly brown hair (not quite at my shoulders).

I tried NoPoo a month ago as I got tired of the following routine: Day 1 - I shampoo and my hair looks frizzy and brittle, Day 2 - it looks nice but slightly greasy Day 3 - looks greasy and need to shampoo 

So I quit shampoo and have been water only since I wanted something completely low maintenance. However, I am now finding that using shampoo was less maintenance than this. My hair constantly feels stuck on my head, it looks bad unless I use dry shampoo. I have to brush it to bring down the oils (never used to brush my hair) but it feels like the oils stay up there. 

I'm close to giving in the towel, as I don't like this feeling. I know there is an awkward stage to get past, but brushing my hair and constantly massaging my hair  is more effort than using shampoo!

Is there something that I could use that is good for wavy hair to keep it ungreasy? I don't really care about the shampoo toxicity stuff, and I'm willing to use it maybe once a week if I have to. Any advice on how to get into a routine for this?",NoPoo
5714,t3_8sy37t,"So as I'm now almost 2 months in NoPoo, I've done my share of experimenting with NoPoo options. Egg yolk wash works the best, but I can't do it every time because of protein build up. After doing some homework, I found that it's the emulsifier aspect of the yolk that washes hair so well : it binds to the excess hair oils and washes right out. So going further down the rabbit hole, I read that soy lecithin is an emulsifier with very little protein. PERFECT. Or so I thought. I started washing my hair with it, scrubbing the granules to my scalp and my hair was nooooot feeling it. In fact, the more I scrubbed, the more it started to dreadlock. For reference, I have medium thickness, straight, shoulder length hair. IT HAS NO BUSINESS DREADLOCKING. It's like the strands started clupming together and they're also sticky??? The best way I could describe it is like if you downed an entire bottle of hair spray in your hair and dumped your head under a faucet for a second - that clumpy, sticky hair feeling. Guys, I don't know how to wash it out. I tried undiluted castille soap and even an anti-residue shampoo I had leftover from my shampoo days. Hardly anything. I cracked two eggs and washed with the egg yolk as well.. all of those things maaaaaybe made it like, 1/5 better. Rubbing alcohol didn't work, and neither did reguar hair oil.

5716,t3_8svwuj,"Hello reddit. I've so far loved my NoPoo experience. I embarked on my 6 month long journey last November, and have kept a simple routine for about 4 months without any interruptions or mishaps. 
I am a dude, and lately I've been sporting a mild, faded undercut with an ever-growing 5 inch top. I don't use any store-bought hair gels, pomades, products etc. A few months back I used to put a little coconut oil in my hair though it left very grotesque and offensive smell within a day or so of applying it. It gave my hair a little more hold though it did not drastically improve anything, so I decided to go with out it. Overall, going NoPoo has given my hair some more hold, meaning that it has been easier to style it and push it up and away from my face without any products. The natural oils and sebum really serve as their own kind of gel or product. However, despite this natural improvement, I'm left wanting something a little better.

I recently went to barbershop for a trim and decided to allow my barber to put a little bit of product in my hair. I must admit, that despite NoPoo making my hair look more natural and healthy, certain products give me a look that I cannot achieve naturally. The barber put some sort of ""tonic"" and fiber gel into my hair, and I really like the way it holds. I don't apply any synthetic products on a daily basis, and I don't think that I ever will, though to see that my hair can look so cool when styled-up with manly (think '60s rockstar) products is certainly refreshing. 
After this ordeal, I decided to wash my hair with a sulfate-containing shampoo for the first time in 4 months (note: I had been strictly water-only during that 4 month period as well), in order to get rid of any build up I had accumulated from the products the barber put in my hair, over time etc. I must admit that it left my hair feeling extremely clean, despite it stripping my hair of its natural oils. However, washing with this shampoo left my hair lifeless and lacking in volume (fell flat on my forehead). The gentlest of winds blew my quiff into a stupid-looking fringe. I decided that I needed to find a natural product that would help me keep my hair off of my face whilst enriching it naturally. I remembered reading about flaxseed hair gels a while back, though I only found it mentioned in strictly curly hair forums, African/frizzy hair oriented forums etc. I wondered if it would work on relatively straight hair, if it could act as a natural styling agent such as more traditional, synthetic hair products for men (flaxseed gel is directed at curly-haired women). I went to the store and bought a bag of flaxseeds, followed a simple recipe I found online, and made my own batch of the gel. I applied it to my hair while damp, and blowdried it for a few minutes. While I found that the hold wasn't as strong as I had hoped, it really does its job well at keeping my hair off of my face. I would consider a light-hold product. Longevity and the nutritional value of this product can be enhanced by adding honey or any of the well known natural oils often discussed on this sub.

*It should be noted that I used this product after washing my hair with sulfate shampoo, thus ridding my hair of it's natural oils. I hope that once my hair returns to equilibrium, which I suspect will happen in about 4-5 days, that the flaxseed gel will work together with my hair's natural oils in order to produce a stronger hold. Thank you for reading and I apologize for the wall of text. 

Verdict: In my experience, flaxseed gel, which is often directed at frizzy or curly haired women, works on shorter and straighter hair, acting as a light-hold product sufficient to keep hair off of one's forehead and or face

This morning they looked alright, oil gives them that wet look tho. I had my friend over for a late lunch and he said nothing about my hair.

Exactly three days after I quit shampoo cold turkey, I noticed dramatic improvements to several key wellness markers:

* Improved mood, energy, and alertness.
* Muscle weakness gone and improved grip.
* Stopped feeling cold all the time.
* No longer sore/stiff after physical labor, such as mowing lawn.
* No more mucus when spitting.
* Less brittle, more manageable hair.

I had made no other changes.  After about a week, the gains seemed less dramatic, but still there.  Perhaps there was a detox period and things had leveled off, I thought.

Adjust your ratios if you need to. If you have very fine hair, use a lot less conditioner. It will weigh your hair down and make it look greasy if you use too much. Also, different conditioners will give you different results. Shea Moisture Weightless conditioner will be much lighter than a coconut oil or castor oil based conditioner. ",NoPoo

Waxiness and dandruff were inmediatly gone. Instead, i got super clean hair when i got out of the shower, but didnt feel heavy or dry as it used to feel when i used shampoo. Still losing lots of hair tho! :c But now i'm sure that's because of my diet.

Its been a week since i did the egg yolk wash, and no rinses in between. My hair right now starts to feel greasy, but really slightly. Compared to how it got super greasy two days after washing it with shampoo, so its a huge difference!.

5766,t3_8lb4ac,"So I let one of my kombucha cultures grow without tending to it and it gave me a hefty-ass 1 inch thick kombucha SCOBY. Has anyone ever tried blending a kombucha SCOBY and making it a thick smoothie type paste to rub in their hair? I've heard of using the kombucha vinegar as a rinse (obvs being acidic, as a substitute for apple cider vinegar or lemon juice), so my logic is why not the SCOBY itself, right? Maybe even add some essential oils to it / blended herbs and stick it in a glass jar in the fridge and take out as much as needed for a shampooing. 
My only reservation is that it's the bacterial / fungal culture itself instead of the vinegar, so I'm wondering if it will mess up hair's bacterial balance.
Am I going too far down the rabbit hole with this? 

Anyways, will experiment and update. If my hair falls out, well.. now we know. 

OK, UPDATE!:
So I cut off a 2x2 piece of SCOBY and blended it with some filtered water. Thanks to Je4Fy, I had the good sense to cut quarter sized pieces with some scissors instead of putting the whole chunk in there and burning my blender motor. I have a good enough blender that it blended into a thicker applesauce-type texture, which is what I wanted. I added a couple drops of Cedarwood and Rosemary essential oils for flavor, but that's not anything new added to my hair. 

The wash went fairly well. I had about 1/3 of a cup of SCOBY which I scrubbed into my hair and left for about 10 min. I rinsed for 2-3 min. 

Upon checking my hair in the mirror, I saw little flakes that you would see when doing a rye flour wash. By this point my hair was half dry and I didn't want to wet it again, so I figured I'd let it dry and then snow-flurry the flakes out (gross, I know, but whatevs). 

Well, it wasn't as easy to snow-flurry as the SCOBY doesn't get dry like rye flour, it's naturally rubbery so it was a pain to get out. It's the next day and I'm still finding small flakes but I'd say it's 95% out. And I have straight, short hair that's not even that thick! I would nooot recommend it for curly or long hair. My naturally soft oily hair also felt dryer and coarser as it was drying, but normalized once dry. 

In closing, I'm not sure I would do it again. The only positive that I can MAYBE see is that I swear my hair grew a little overnight. But then again, I'm using EO and Biotin to stimulate hair growth, sooo.. the jury's still out on that one. But it also seems coincidental. hmmph. 
Also, my scalp feels slightly tingly/itchy here and there (like if you didn't rinse out your apple cider vinegar well enough), but I don't know if that's just my paranoia that I washed my hair with a living bacterial and fungal paste. 

TL;DR: Yeah.. I honestly don't think I'd try it again. The SCOBY is just too much of a pain to wash out and I didn't care for the coarser texture while it was drying. Anyways, it was worth the experiment!",NoPoo

5800,t3_8eu50a,"Thanks for any insight on this. I just cleaned my BBB for the first time (had it for about a month, been using it on day 2 and 3 after washing) and there was a lot of white filminess on the bristles, and the hairs that I pulled out felt filmy and gross as well. Is it normal for the brush to collect grossness, or can I expect it to lessen over time? Or is it a sign that I should change my routine, even though I thought it was working well for my hair?

It's weird because my scalp hasn't been flaky, and my hair does start to feel dirty by day 3 after washing, but it is never as gross as this brush felt before cleaning it.

(My routine: The last time I used shampoo was 2/28/18 and since then I've been washing with diluted Dr. Bronner's followed by a diluted ACV rinse and cool water. 2 days between washes for the month of March, and since 4/1 I've been going for 3 days between washes.

Currently I’m off it, partly due to problems I’ve had trying to wash out the rogaine residue (I’ve used the foam, haven’t tried the liquid version).

In the past, I’ve ended up shampooing way too much - at least once a day, and ended up with a terribly dry scalp. 

I’ve been trying out the nopoo life for a couple weeks now, and my hair feels great. I’m tempted to get back on the rogaine to slow down the balding process, but I’m worried I’ll just fall back into the same old cycle of dry scalp problems.

My home water is extremely hard, you can even smell the chlorine in it when you run the shower. So I tried a chelating shampoo (kenra clarifying), thinking maybe my issues were caused by buildup. 

Well, that was last night, and today my scalp is very flaky and all the acnes look pretty much the same, possibly, slightly worse.

5814,t3_8c4nzr,"My best friend has been trying to get me to go no-poo for years now. It has never worked for me. Until now.

About my hair: Naturally dirty blonde, about 20-30% gray, frequently highlighted (as in every 6 weeks-two months; very fine hair, but not necessarily thin, has a lot of volume when blown dry straight; waves/ curls a bit (2b-c depending on length) yet without any rhyme or reason.  Hair currently is about an inch or two below my chin (i.e., not quite long enough to put into a neat sleek pony tail). I haven't worn my hair this long in ages because it typically breaks off before it gets past my shoulders, and just looks ratty. And when it's that long and I put it in a hairband, it's just so fine, well, we call it ""the nubbin."" And I have to tie the hairband so tight since it'll just slip off, it results in breakage. My hair prefers the dreaded clippy, but this is 2018. :-(

My ends typically always look dry and destroyed. But oils just don't work either. Over the years I've tried it all - jojoba, morrocan, coconut oil, olive oil.. before, during after shower, and overnight with a cap on. It just sits on my hair making it look like a super shiny grease pit, and doesn't seem to absorb. Though does soften my hair -- once I shampoo it out.

Also - a big ALSO - I have had scalp psoriasis since I was a child. It can get really bad, as in covering my entire scalp. This isn't dandruff either. Big flakes, lots of itch. Prescription shampoo (Clobetasal) works great to control it, but if I've run out then I am abusing my hair with all kinds of harsh tar shampoos. 

I am really careful to avoid chlorine or salt water or too much sun, as all of that can result in straw hair for me. Yet my hair plumps up and/or frizzes in high humidity. Which sometimes can make it look great, I just can't predict. 

Best friend aforementioned has gorgeous thick straight long hair, which she washes only once a week, and looks perfect regardless of the weather. She insists it's as fine and thick as mine, but I just don't see it.

So I have tried this no-poo thing numerous times over the years, yearning for same healthy head of hair, with zero success. Even if I could endure the grease of day 2 / 3 hair, I couldn't endure the psoriasis flare up which was unbearable. 

Then I got a new hairdresser who recommended a new shampoo and conditioner, which is sulfate, paraben, and silicone free. I have been using it daily for 6 months.  Alternating with the prescription shampoo every now and then... and then less and less. Because my scalp has totally cleared up! It's never felt better!!!!

Two weeks ago I decided to give no-poo one last try. My girlfriend is visiting me at the end of this month so I figured I could maybe try until then. 

Week one I was able to go 6 days without washing!!!!! I am amazed. I've never been able to go that long. (Note I did one last wash with the Rx shampoo, no conditioner. Then I did a WO wash a few times the first week, and co-washed when needed for de-tangling. Then on the last day tried curly girl method -- using olive oil-- and it was a disaster so I shampooed). 

This week, I am on day 6 again and I think I can push it at least one more day, as I invested in a BBB brush which does seem to be helping. I still seemed to need to WO wash it twice this week, and I put on just a little (like a teaspoon) worth of conditioner on the ends to de-tangle in the shower with a wide-tooth comb. 

I'd love to let my natural waves go free, but I'm finding that my hair seems to want to be blown dry straight. I am thinking that the heat of the blow dryer helps the sebum penetrate the shaft or something? It definitely looks and feels the best when I blow dry it straight after a WO wash.

I'll add here that in the past I did try dry shampoos, but they left me unbearably itchy on the scalp, so much so, I had to hop in the shower. I'll also add that I am very hesitant to try BS or ACV, as I am reading mix reviews about their effects.

I've been trying out the no poo method for well over a month now, and I'm still having problems. My hair is straight and very fine, at collarbone length, half grown out natural and half damaged from bleach thanks to a mishap a couple years ago with a stylist. The worst of it has been cut off long ago but compared to my natural virgin hair it's an entirely different type of hair altogether. 

I don't shower often because of my eczema anyway, so I have already been keeping my hair washing to a minimum before I started going no poo, but I still can't find a balance. Every time I go through all the effort of BBB, masks, baking soda, vinegar, etc, my hair will ALWAYS come out after a shower being overly oily on my roots and dry as heck on the damaged parts and the ends. It's driving me up the wall. I already have naturally blonde hair so too much oil always stands out no matter what I do. As a result I end up having to put cornstarch into my freshly washed hair and I am starting to feel skeptical about people who talk about healthy shiny hair when mine has to end up being a matte mess all the time. 

I try honey, and my hair gets dry. I try oils, and I can't get them out unless I use egg which often I don't have the time for at that point. It's a nightmare. 
Currently I've had a honey and kefir mask on overnight, showered normally today and my ends are so dry they are crunchy, but still somehow oily roots despite doing baking soda and vinegar in the shower. 

For extra info: I have hard water, but I did get a shower filter. It's not a full water softener but its the best I can do. I also can't find any ACV where I am (Poland), so I've been using diluted white vinegar. I also dilute my baking soda quite a bit (about 1/5 to water). 

What am I missing here? Should I revert to using shampoo and conditioner until my damaged hair grows out completely?

5847,t3_85prnu,"**Background**

&amp;nbsp;

Ever since I've taken finding the right look and haircut for myself seriously, I've realized that every time I used shampoo, my hair would puff up and become frizzy after drying. I'm currently growing out my hair to go for a ""short on sides, long on top"" kind of haircut for my curly hair.

Something like this: https://i.imgur.com/bRQ1jNp.jpg

Right now I'm combing my hair flat to the side to avoid looking like an overgrown bush while I await my next haircut appointment.
I have thick, black, wavy hair (the degree of which is undetermined as I have not yet grown it long enough) with low porosity.

&amp;nbsp;

**Approach**

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I grabbed the bull by the horn and started off doing water only once a week on Fridays and am pleasantly surprised with the results. I have been sporadically following the scritching, preening, boar-bristle brushing (SPB) routine every 1-4 days, depending on how my scalp and hair feel from justprimalthings.com albeit not having a boar bristle brush, which I substituted by gripping bundles of hair with my fingers and running through their length in different patterns.

&amp;nbsp;

**Week 1**

* Hair feels much oilier, though not as bad as I've read through other posts. Hands feel quite oily after running hands through hair.
* Hair feels really solid, crusty, and clumpy after taking a shower, taking on a straw-like consistency and texture.
* Hair dried really quick and I had itchy / dry scalp later in the day, and next few days.

&amp;nbsp;

**Observations:**

I believe I my hair had a straw-like texture because I had just begun this schedule after using shampoo, I also used hot water when showering because I thought I would be A-OK as long as I did not use shampoo, however week 2 proved that wrong. I finished my shower with cold water (knob turned all the way). This is also the week when I used a lot of coconut oil on my ends to reverse the damage from using my old hair products.

&amp;nbsp;

**Week 2**

* Hair feels less oily, I feel like my oils have distributed themselves more evenly throughout my hair
* Hair feels softer, heavier, silkier, w/ more structural integrity and less frizz. This is more true in the front of my head rather than the back, which still somewhat has a straw-like texture. Perhaps I need to moisturize that area?
* No longer feels like straw and retains moisture for a really long time after combing and flattening it, and it stayed moist after drying.

&amp;nbsp;

**Observations:**

This time when showering, I used warm water instead of hot water. I think this helped to retain the natural oils from my hair and allow them to keep their ability to stay moisturized even after drying, since hot water strips too much oils and dries out my hair.

Another thing I've noticed is that when I use cold water to wash, it feels like there is a lot of friction going on between my fingers and my hair, however when I use warmer water the hair feels much softer when washing and less friction goes on. I definitely would have considered washing with cold water if it didn't feel like I was pulling my hair all the time. Can someone explain this? Rinsed with cold water to cool down hair and close up hairs sheaths and pores.

&amp;nbsp;

**Pictures**

Before: https://imgur.com/a/Kv4um

After: https://imgur.com/a/Bk7sv

&amp;nbsp;

The pictures were taken at night, and my hair is completely dry in all of the photos. Its appearance today has deviated very little from the shape that I combed it into after my morning shower, and what astonishes me is the difference in how easily I can style my hair, how moisturized it feels, the difference in frizz, and how it keeps its shape. If you look at the last image with the top view of my head, you'll notice that the pattern of the hair at the front looks different than the pattern from the back. Compared to the front, the back is clumpier, frizzier, and drier, reminiscent of the old appearance of my hair - though not as much as when I first started.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion / TL;DR**

&amp;nbsp;

All in all, my hair has reduced in frizziness, has become much easier to sculpt, retains moisture better, feels softer, dries quicker, and is less oily on non-wash days. This is evident in the change of appearance of my frontal hair, although not as pronounced in the back parts of my scalp for some reason. Perhaps it needs time to catch up.

By the end of those months my hair was able to go a couple days without being covered in grease but the third day there was no way it looked presentable. I figured I was just doomed to super greasy hair all the time if I wanted to stay away from shampoo so I quit.

A few days ago I decided to try again. I'm on the 5th day of just washing with water and my hair is not greasy at all!! I'm going to have no trouble keeping it up this time and I'm so happy. 

The only reason I can imagine such a change is because a few weeks ago I started trying to be super healthy which included going vegan and cutting out all processed food. I haven't been pregnant or anything else I can think of that would have had an impact on my hormones. Literally the only changes I've made between now and two years ago is my diet. 

I didn't even eat a lot of meat in the first place either. I did eat a lot of processed food though. I could have guessed that quitting meat would result in somewhat less grease being produced but the difference is astounding to me. And it's only been a few days so I expect it to just get better as time goes on. I'd say probably half the hair is pulled out when I brush after showering and my head has stopped being itchy (I decided to quit shampoo again cause I was starting to get hives, yikes).

I just wanted to share that with you guys. Especially if you're already considering a lifestyle change, this is just one more reason to do it. I'm already feeling physically better than I have in my life too. It was a hard change to make but so worth it, and now I'm just waiting till my hair starts looking fuller and nicer too :D",NoPoo

5853,t3_852sc4,"I've been creeping on this forum but officially I'm brand new to reddit and I've joined now in desperate search for some WO help.
I feel like I've been doing EVERYTHING right but the last week and a half I've got a terrible waxy build-up and dandruff. This is gonna be a long one, I'm sorry...

I've been doing WO for a month, but have been no-poo for about a year and a half using shampoo bars and ACV. My hair is long and wavy/curly, not quite thin, but definitely not thick. So here's my routine:
The first couple of weeks of WO my hair got greasy obviously, but I was **scritching, preening and using my BBB** with good effect. I've been scritching and preening when washing as well, first with **hot water, then cold**. My hair's been a little greasy, but I've been able to wear it down for a day or so without looking too gross. I squeeze most water out of my hair and then put it up in a **t-shirt** for a couple of minutes only, and apply **jojoba oil** to the ends. I detangle with a wide toothed comb. I use my BBB every other night before bed, and I sleep on a **silk pillowcase** that I rinse every other day if I'm too lazy to do a proper wash. I sometimes BBB in the morning if my hair is very greasy. I've been **washing every two or three days**. I know for sure I have **soft water** so that shouldn't be a problem. The last week I also tried washing with **only cold water**, but it just didn't dissolve anything properly and hair looked the same as when I got in the shower.

I had little specks of dandruff in varying amounts when I was nopoo, but nothing like this. This feels as if I've used a no poo bar with no ACV rinse in hard water for the first time ever... It's difficult to preen even because it's so waxy. My brush is also covered in white dust after having thoroughly cleaned it and used it just one time. What the fork is up with my hairs!? I really really want so bad to be WO and it's so frustrating when I feel like I've been doing everything right, I was on the right track and now I'm just confused and have bad hair..

**TLDR; Please read the bolds anyway I'm sorry this is so long!!!**

But with the oncoming hot weather I sweat and notice my hair getting oilier and less voluminous. Should i do something else to solve the oily issue now that it's going to get hotter where I live? 
The only thing I've done thus far is water wash every other day and scrub scalp and my hair has been fine. ",NoPoo
5875,t3_813leg,"I've been doing No-Poo for about two months, and I want to share some things I've noticed/potential benefits, for all the struggling people out there.

A bit of background first: my hair is about shoulder-length, mostly straight, not very dense, extremely low-porosity, and has leftover highlights. I've had various scalp issues, and my hair has always gotten really oily really fast, and so I've tried various methods, but I never washed it more than once every 5 days because it was too much of a hassle. Before really starting no-poo I had been unknowingly using a silicone-free shampoo, and I had also been dilluting it, so my transition period was definitely not as bad as it could've been.
So here are some changes I've noticed:

**Hair never feels gross** - No matter what conventional shampoo I used, my hair would always get really greasy at the crown on day 3, and it would kind of clump together, so much so that I could barely run my hands through it. Now, while it never feels as 'clean' as it used to with conventional shampoo, even after 7 days of not washing it doesn't feel half as gross as it used to after 3 days. I could go a lot longer and it would be fine, but I choose not to because for once in my life I actually enjoy washing it.

**Never feels dried out** - With conventional shampoo, it always felt like I had two different hair textures: the crown always oily and clumped together, but the roots always dry and brittle. Whereas now its texture in general feels different, more uniform, with the highlights only a tiny bit drier than the rest, but not enough to be a problem. Also I never get tangles anymore.

**More volume** - Conventional shampoo always made it frizzy, unnaturally puffy, and really hard to manage. Now it has more volume, it never looks limp, no matter what I use on it, and the individual strands feel a lot stronger.

**Grows faster** - I never really wanted to grow it out, but there was always a point when it kind of just... stopped growing, even if I trimmed it regularly. But now it grows incredibly fast, probably because of all the brushing and massaging I've been doing. 

**Less scalp problems** - I'm pretty sure I have seb-derm, but on top of that I would often get random bursts of dandruff, and I didn't know what to do about it, apart from buying anti-dandruff shampoo, which didn't do anything. There might not be much I can do against the seb-derm, but at least now the rest of my scalp never feels dry, flaky, or itchy as it used to, so I'm satisfied.

**No more hair-loss** - I had a period of time when for whatever reason I lost so much hair on a daily basis, it was really bothersome, but I didn't know the cause. Now I brush it a lot more often than I used to, but even then, and even when I wash it, I don't think I lose a third the amount that I used to.

**Dries slower** - I don't know how much of a good thing this is, but it definitely doesn't start drying as soon as I get out of the shower as it used to. I had a few weeks when it didn't feel dry even after half a day, but now it takes about 4-5 hours at most. Might be my hair freaking out, or the cold weather. I'm not too bothered.

For reference, I started No-Poo by using stuff like honey, tea, rye flour, etc. for a few weeks, and deep-conditioning often. I haven't yet found a method that works perfectly long-term, but I've been experimenting with shampoo bars, and at least I've found some natural things my hair likes (mostly acidic stuff. Fermented rice water works wonders). If I find a shampoo bar I like, I might stick with that for a while, but my long-term goal is to go water-only, if possible.

What worked for me might not work for you, but if you're struggling, I would strongly suggest not to give up, just try different things, and most of all, listen to your hair. You'll get there one day. ",NoPoo

Recently found this sub and figured it would be a great start in getting some tips in becoming NoPoo!

Back when I was in school I had started NoPoo, maybe washed my hair once a week with shampoo. At some point I started using goats milk soap(in attempt to reduce my plastic consumption) to wash my hair but soon my hair turned out a little waxy and felt weird and heavy (after reading in this sub I found out maybe washing with cold water would change this, but havent attempted yet).

However, I've recently started a new job where I want to look good so I don't want to put my hair up...

Because of that, i decided to try the baking soda and chamomile tea method of cleansing (i didn't had any acv in hand) just to get rid of the oil. My goal was to be water only if it was possible.
I did the recommended 1 tbsp per cup. And the baking soda felt very slippery, until i rinsed it off and it felt kind of hard? Now my hair feels harder and even greasier. Yet i noticed when i brush, it left like a white residue on the bristles. And upon close inspection, my hair has tiny white dots too ): 

I do have dandruff however since i started the nopoo it seems  to have calmed a bit. I read the sidebar and thought this may be because of the water. Maybe it's just too hard for me to be water only. So i have a couple questions:

1.- should i go back to shampoo?
2.- or are there methods of nopoo that won't react with my hard water?

5896,t3_7xl9d8,"Hey all

So I’ve been trying to go fully no poo for about 6 months, but I never really managed to go past 1-2 weeks without washing my hair with a sulfate free shampoo. My hair would get stringy and unmanageable, my head would get itchy, and I’d get cystic pimples all over my scalp that would make the hair fall out

I tried different methods; boar bristle brushes, lemon washes, ACV washes, leaving it as long as I could. The best method I ever came across was mixing about a teaspoon of Tea Tree oil with 1-2 tablespoons of water, and lathering that in my hair. Helped a lil with the itchiness and made my hair a bit softer, but never completely helped. My hair would still get gross and oily and itchy a few days later.

Enter aloe vera. 
At my parents house we have heaps of massive Aloe plants, which I frequently use on my skin. 
I mixed about a tablespoon of aloe with 2 tablespoons of water, and a few drops of rosemary oil and tea tree oil. 
How much aloe you use should depend on your hair (I have fine, mid-back length hair, closest to hair type 2A) as you want to try and completely cover at least your scalp
I left the aloe mix in my hair for 3 hours before rinsing it out in the shower, not following up with any shampoo or conditioner

It’s been nearly a week and my hair isn’t even slightly oily. It’s so soft and manageable; it’s never been this nice! 
Aloe vera has the same PH balance as our hair (6), so I believe it perfectly conditions it. Unlike other methods, like ACV and lemon which are slightly more acidic than our hair, the aloe balances our hair so the scalp doesn’t need to produce more oils! 

TLDR: Mix 1 tablespoon aloe with 1-2 tablespoons water, and a few drops of an oil of your choice for the nicest, most amazing hair of your life!

So two things - 

1. Near the end of the week it gets super dandruff-y and itchy. I've never had dandruff so do I need to wash more often? Or will it adjust? I'm trying to was less because it feels so nice and soft towards the end of the week and I lose that when I wash it.

5901,t3_7xhk1n,"I'm a male. Trying to grow long hair. I don't really know or remember when i entered the awkward stage, but i think i am still in it, as i dont find my hair flattering. They just dont fall down the way i want them. The only thing right now that makes me feel somewhat attractive is a bun. And with my lenght its not a twist bun but a fold bun.
I noticed that when I wash my hair with shampo (and conditioner) my hair gets very puffy when it dries. Doesn't matter if I let it dry naturally or if i blowdry, when it dries it just gets super puffy which makes it unmanageable. It just settles into a middlepart which to me (at least at this lenght) looks awful and if i try to flip it to one one side it just falls back and wiggles around. If i try to make bun (probably cuz of my lenght) the front hair just escapes the rubber band, meaning i have to tie it up all over again every now and then. It doesn't have any grip. But when a day or sometimes two days go since shamooping its much easier to manage. Easier to flip it over to one side and make it stay like that, and much easier to make a bun.
I read that sulphates makes your hair puffy. So i bought sulphate free shampoo and for now i washed my hair three timss with it. Its still puffy afterwards but much less than with regular shampoo with sulphates. And a bit easier to manage on the first day.

Now I'm here asking: if i go nopoo will my hair always look and feel like the second day hair and be easier to manage? (i dont really mind if i have to water wash it every day, just so it doesnt look puffy). 

And also I saw on youtube a girl talking about nopoo and she was not satisfied. She said it made her hair gummy, and when she started using shampoo again her hair stayed gummy. I dont think i want that. So how often does it happen that someone gets gummy hair? Does it depend on hair type and skint type or did that girl do something wrong?

And also i think i have quite greasy hair. On day three or four i already have to wash it cuz i look gross and actually feels gummy like the youtuber girl said. So could that potentially be a problem?
Other than oily, grease hair, i never had much problems with my scalp (no itchiness; never had much or actually any dandruff at all, even when i had shorter hair and used styling products, although with short hair i did wash it with water only and every day, but thats short hair now i am growing it long and its already quite long).

And my older sister is the worst, every time she visits, she tells me to wash it properly with shampoo and that I have to stop being dirty.

It's been only a week since the last shampoo and my hairs are not that bad. A bit oily at the roots but nothing disgusting (I mostly keep my hairs in a bun with just a towel drying). The ends are dry but I want to see where it goes on a longer run. I saw that I'm suppose to use cold water to keep the sebum from going away and produce more and to close the pores. But, I just can't use cold water, even just for a minute. My brain won't allow it and I will probably be grumpy all day long. I know it is a caprice but you know, we all have some.

5922,t3_7vz49v,"I haven't washed my hair with shampoo in over a year. I'm a guy with very straight, usually short to medium length hair.

My method is basically very throughly rinsing with the hottest water I can stand about once a week. That seems to be enough. Afterwards I use a concoction my sister made called ""leg balm"". Basically my Dad has varicose veins, so my sister tried to make him something to rub into his legs. Its a mix of coconut oil, sunflower oil, beeswax, and some other stuff she wouldn't tell me. I essentially use it like hair wax, but it doesn't leave my hair feeling greasy. You have to heat it up in your hands to melt the beeswax, but after that its just like any hair wax. I don't have to do anything else to my hair after that, it maintains pretty good volume and doesn't blow around in the wind much. People still ask me how I get my hair to look so good, and its really satisfying to tell them I literally put less effort in than anyone they know.

I started doing this years ago, back when I had long hair (first year of college ftw). I would get tangles, dandruff and split ends constantly. Eventually I went travelling and had no access to showers, and after two months I came back home and everyone commented on how healthy my hair looked. I just never restarted washing it from then on. During those two months, it was a little uncomfortable to have natural oils in my hair, but I stopped noticing it after a while. The benefits quickly outweighed any negatives.

The only downside is I occasionally get an itchy scalp, but thats usually a good indicator that it needs a through rinse. I rinse more often in hot weather too.",NoPoo

I dilute the juice of half a lemon on 500 ml of water and use that to wash my hair, but i don't rinse the lemon water because if i do, the hard water makes my hair waxy again.

The problem i have is that sometimes i feel my scalp a little bit irritated, always have white flakes on my hair and when i put my fingers on my scalp, it feels dry with almost no oil.

If i use any less than half a lemon on 500 ml of water, it makes no effect and it's like washing with only water. So i wanted to ask if there is something i can do to stop the white flakes and dryness in the scalp. So far i've found on the internet that aloe vera spray may help.

(Also, because i live in Venezuela, i don't have access to more fancy stuff such as essential oils which are hard to find or very expensive due to the economic situation, or rye flour, which doesn't exist here because rye isn't grown here.

Initially I bought a shampoo bar which I planned to use for the greasy transition phase but I only ended up using it a couple of times as it made my hair feel exactly the same as when I would use Head and Shoulders, which I used daily before discovering this sub.

And you can probably guess why I was using H&amp;S before I ditched shampoo altogether.  I was hoping that NoPoo would solve my dandruff issue but here I am a year later and while I am thrilled with the texture and life of my hair, it ironically didn't do the one thing I was hoping it would.

I was hoping I could get some input on changing up my routine to try to curb this issue.  The only thing that may have helped was one time my gf rubbed my scalp with some coconut oil and I seem to remember having a few days of improvement following that.  To be perfectly honest I never made the connection until typing this out. lol

5935,t3_blrdtf,"[Video on 5 Great Alternatives to Shampoo](https://youtu.be/Eo8wvesS1kk)

Hello Reddit!It’s FreeDaFro here to deliver the knowledge once again. Today, I will share with you 4 great alternative to Shampoo. As you already know from reading my previous videos, Shampoo is the enemy of my hair. Shampoo takes sebum oil out of your. By stripping your hair of sebum oil, shampoo can cause dry hair, breakage, and decreased hair growth.

The four methods I’m sharing with you today do not throw off your hair’s balance of sebum oil. All of these methods that I am sharing with you today are cheap and naturals. If you want stronger, darker, and thicker hair, I recommend that your use a combination of all of these methods. Each product provides its own unique benefits and the use of a variety of products will produce maximize your hair’s potential over time. These methods are list in no particular order. I find all of these products essential to my hair care regimen.

So here we go:

#1 Onion Juice:

So the first product I recommend you guys to start using is onion juice.
Onion juice is a cheap &amp; natural way to speed up you hair growth.  Onions are great for your hair and body. Onions contain a high amount of sulfur. Sulfur will speeds up your hair growth.Sulfur kills bacteria that rest on your scalp. These bacteria block clog our scalp and prevent hair follicles from emerging from our scalp. Sulfur removes this blockage allowing our hair to grow faster. Sulfur allows helps to remove dandruff from our scalp. Onion juice allows increases the blood flow to your scalp leading to increased hair growth.


Since I started using onion juice in my hair, my hair has become thicker and darker. When you first use it, your scalp will feel like its on fire. That feeling is the onion juice killing all of the bacteria in your hair. I know the idea of putting onion juice in your hair may be appalling to some people. Some of you may be concerned about a lingering onion smell being left in your hair after your hair after you use this method. I usually put  castor oil and conditioner in my hair after I use onion juice. This helps reduce the smell of onions in my hair.

If you want to make onion juice, all you simply need to is cut up and boil and onion. Let the mixture sit in your hair for 1 -2 hours. After letting it sit, rinse your hair with water. Make sure you avoid getting this product in your eyes.

If you commit to using onion juice on a consistent basis, you will see your hair get thicker and fuller.

#2 Clay Mask:

The next thing I recommend you guys try is a clay mask. 
Clay is another natural product of the earth. There are great clays out there Each has its own unique benefits. There are many recipes online but all these recipes have some of the same benefits.
Clays masks do a great job of detoxifying our hair. Tap water contains harmful metals such as lead and chlorine. Overtime, these metals build up in our hair and damage our scalp. Clay’s magnetic properties allow it to carry the metals out of our hair. Clay also kill bacteria in our scalp.

Another great thing about clay mask is that they remove oily buildup from our hair strands. Clays act like a sponge in our hair and they will soak up excess oil that lies on our hair strands. As clays coat our hair strand, it begins to fill in holes on our hair stands. This strengthens our hair and improves our curly pattern.

As I said, there are many clays for our scalp, each has its own benefits. Clay is a great alternative to shampoo because its PH level is more favorable to our scalp. Clay is a gentler way to clean your hair and it reinforces the damaged spots on your hair, unlike shampoo.  There are many clay mask recipes online. I recommend you use this product to remove build-up on your hair.


#3 Apple Cider Vinegar:

The next one I am gonna share you guys is a popular one. Apply Cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is a staple in the natural hair care community. Apple cider vinegar can remove dirty from your hair. Its best property is its ability to break apart sebum oil. When sebum oil is broken into tinier particles, it is easier to move from your scalp to your hair strands. Remember sebum is good from our hair strands because it seals help to seal in moisture. 

Since I started using apple cider vinegar my hair has become more flexible and shiny. I can comb my hair in every direction. I’ve also notice my hair has beomce more shiny too.

* Nice spray cleanse
* Adds shine
* Makes hair easier to manipulate

#4: Co-washing:

Y’all have probably heard of this one before. Co washing is a conditioner only wash. Cowashing creates a protective layer over your hair strands that help seal in moisture. Co washing is a great way to clean your hair throughout the week. If you just came back from the beach or the gym, it is a great way to quickly refresh your hair without removing any oil. 

Be careful. If done incorrectly, co washing can be harmful for our hair. The protective layer created by cowashing doesn’t allow moisture to penetrate into it. If this protective layer is always on your hair, you will not be able to get water into your hair. Overtime you will experience hair breakage. Also avoid putting conditioner on your scalp, conditioner will clog the pores on your scalp. 

You can cowash with any hair conditioner. I recommend that co wash no more that 3 times a week.",NoPoo

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I have long, straight hair that gets greasy on day two, and I just think washing it is boring. I tried no poo for about 6 months a couple of years ago, but ended up ditching it after travelling a lot and dealing with different kinds of water.   


I've read that scritching, preening and BBBing is essential to no poo, but is that absolutely necessary, or is that just if you do WO?   


I've just started up a no poo routine again, and am currently washing once a week with diluted baking soda (1 tbsp BS + 1 cup water) and using diluted white wine vinegar as a leave-in conditioner. (works amazeballs, but isn't the BS removing a lot of the natural oils? Seeing as the hair gets so squeaky clean) My plan is to move to rye flour after a couple of weeks, when the transition phase is hopefully over, because I've read that BS is damaging to your hair over time. And rye flour worked well the last time I tried it, if I remember correctly.  


Any tips for me? Also, do I really need to deep condition? If so, what's the easiest vegan way to do it?

I've been on and off water only for a bit now. I'm on and off because of my lifestyle and because I love the feeling of super squeaky clean hair. 

I have dry, damaged and thick Asian hair but after lots of botched box dyes and allergic reactions to conditioners to relieve the damage, I've lost/broken alot of it. Weaning into water only really helped the damage and growth, but every time it would get a little too oily, I'd give into shampoo. 

But recently I discovered Shikakai and Reetha Powder as shampoo -- and OH MY GOSH GUYS. My hair is soft, sleek, and moisturized, and it has that squeaky clean feeling. My hair has less breakage and it looks like it too!  

If you guys have not tried it, I highly recommend it. I also live in a college town with moderately hard water, and still dont need an acv rinse. I'm super excited that this is working out and that this is so much better than what I could've expected! I'm really surprised not more people are talking about it.

I've started nopoo for 2.5 months by only using baking soda and vinegar wash once ever two days (I seriously didn't know it's not recomended). My hair grew out so fast. All my life I've combatted hair thinning and this transition worked so well my hair has never been so thick! FYI I am asian with black straight hair and has thin hair genetics. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Then I went to the beach and gave into shampoo because I didn't have baking soda with me. That was for a week, then I came home and continued using shampoo because I was out of baking soda. I switched back to shampoo for 2 -3 weeks and finally came back to baking soda. It's still working - my hair is beautiful but it's not the same anymore as when I started. I'm one week back into baking soda &amp; vinegar and washing it once every 2-3 days, but I have been feeling that the baking soda maybe too strong for me, so today I tried just water and then dandruffs appeared right away.

I'm also going to dye my hair next week with chemical. I don't want natural alternative simply because I don't know how to get the right color and has no experience in dying it myself ever. My question is what should be my nopoo routine? I have a BBB that I don't use as well. I've read so many articles about dying hair and alternative nopoo routine, but there are too many choices and I don't know which one would work best.

5969,t3_bf91d4,"Hello everyone! I started no poo water only two months ago. I used to wash my hair with Lush shampoo bars or a natural bar I bought on a market in Turkey (they said it was made from olive oil). No conditioner. 

I am currently travelling around Asia and therefore I mostly only wash my hair with cold water. It never felt clean after a wash, actually just more oily. I try to really wash it and rub my scalp a lot. I also dry my hair with a t shirt instead of a towel. I see no difference.

I have thin hair, but because of my waves it doesn't look that way. In those two months it actually looks fine and full. It's just that the feel is very very very oily. I can not get with my fingers through my hair all the way from the scalp. I thought it was just part of the transition but yesterday I noticed very gross and thick layers of, as it looks like, fat/oil build up near my scalp that make my hairs get stuck to each other. I was able to brush those out with three different kind of brushes. A round soft brush, a tangle teezer and a fine comb. That made my whole hair more oily instead of mostly at the scalp. In those last two months I just used the soft round brush, maybe I couldn't reach my scalp that way and therefore the build up?

I am currently in India and it's kind of hard to get a BBB. Same for the shampoos without silicones or sulfates. So I'd rather go through this process without. Is that even possible? Will it just take longer and do I have to be patience? Or am I doing something wrong?

1. I use hair oils a lot, like Coconut oil, Almond oil, Argan oil etc.  and usually wash them out with a shampoo. How would I go about washing them out if I'm going nopoo? Or do I just rub my scalp with normal water and let the oils hopefully soak in and fade away naturally? And I usually condition too, is conditioning recommended during nopoo? And a certain kind? Or is any old conditioner fine?
2. I aim to dye my hair once I'm done with college, in about 2 months or so. I haven't admittedly read up on maintaining dyed hair and all yet since the act is still far off, but is it okay to go nopoo while having dyed hair?

The second day it already looks terrible, is super itchy, and I think it smells. I put up with it to avoid washing it every day, but it's frustrating and makes me uncomfortable, especially at work. I'm thinking of trying lowpoo and eventually transitioning to using no shampoo, but I don't know where to start.

I bought a dry shampoo yesterday just to try it out, but I know it's not a real fix.

I have a lot of hair, but it is very thin and frizzy. It's medium length and chestnut brown. Near my forehead, it's very rough and broken. I also live in a place with humidity averaging 75% (usually ranges from 60-85%), which makes dealing with oily hair more difficult.

5975,t3_bel08f,"I'm travelling at the moment and I want to give no poo a try. Let me first fill you in on some background. I have normal skin that tends towards dehydration. My scalp health is good too. No dandruff or other scalp problems. My hair length goes to my shoulders and I have a fringe. I'm blessed with curly hair but if there's lots of moisture in the hair it's frizzy af. I can only achieve my curly hair through product and if I want it to really bang, I need heat too. I've some blonde at the bottom half of my hair which is in good condition. I currently can get 5-6 days from each wash. My hair always looks it's best on day 3-4, because the natural oils dampen down the frizz and flyaways. I never use dry shampoo because I'm lazy. 

Now for my routine. Before I get into the shower, I run my fingers vigorously over my scalp for a few minutes. I find this is really helping with the itchiness. When I'm in the shower, I scrub my scalp under the hot water as if I'm washing my hair as usual. I'm not conditioning my hair shafts but I don't have any. I don't brush my hair because I've curly hair and it makes my hair frizzy. I've no idea if the water in the countries I visit have hard or soft water. I'm travelling through the middle East and Central Asia, with a single 40L bag, so I don't have a ton of space. 

I'm only 7 days in and I'm really feeling the grease. At the front of my head it's okay, but the back of my crown is flat with oil. Luckily I'm in a country that requires me to wear a headscarf but this won't be the case in a few days. I'm not at home so when I go to a shop to buy conditioner, I have no idea what I'm buying. The hair shafts are in good condition and I think I'm getting a good distribution of the oil through my hair, save for the back where it seems to be gathering. 

Now, I'm looking for some feedback on 2 fronts. How does my routine sound? How did you cope with the transition? Curly haired no poo people, how do you spread your hair's natural loveliness through to the ends without compromising your curl? Those who started when travelling, what did you do? How did you adapt your no poo when you don't have access to the same products at home.

I started that routine and didn’t wash my hard after 10/17/18. However, two weeks ago, my hair just got extremely oily and heavy at the roots and so very, very dry at the ends. I was at a loss... I stopped coconut oil and just did aloe vera and ACV, but it didn’t cut it. 

Finally, I Googled natural shampoos for SD and found WOW, an ACV shampoo on Amazon. Since my trouble was so immediate, I called my local beauty shop to see if they sold ACV shampoo and they didn’t, but suggested Whole Foods. I picked up Avalon Organics ACV shampoo and conditioner. 

I’ve been in Heaven since!! She shampoo is so cleansing and leaves my hair squeaky clean and the conditioner is so rich and creamy, my hair is just wonderfully soft.. and my hands, too!!! 

It’s all natural ingredients, no sulfates and other junk. I do have a little, tiny itch by my ears, so I might pre-treat with ACV/water mix before shampoo next time. Otherwise, my hair looks and feels great!!! Lots of body, no flyaways.. and, when I want to “go curly”, it’s not frizzy like it usually is.

- almond oil (juste the tip of my fingers) + tea tree essential oil massage for 5 minutes
- shampoo with hot water, baking soda (half table spoon) and tea tree essential oil.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a ""no-pooer"" but I am now considering it since reading about it but that's beside the point. I wasnt sure where else to ask this so it seems like a community of lots of boar bristle brush users might be the place.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought my BBB as I read its good for fine hair, oily at the roots, dry at the ends.

&amp;#x200B;

I've used it twice now and both times left my scalp REALLY itchy afterwards. I'm chalking it up to the fact that I probably have a huge amount of pollution build up and I'm only now releasing it so my scalp is going through some kind of detox but wanted to see if anyone else experienced this or have any other ideas as to why this is happening? Also any advice for the itchiness?

Well that didn't work, my hair was gross and oily after that, like the rinsing did not seem to do anything to clean my hair. However I find shampoo even natural shampoo can dry my hair out more than it is, and causes dandruff or dry scalp. So I guess I am wondering how effective vinegar can be as a hair wash instead of shampoo...I tried it once and it seemed to at least make my scalp feel better. But yeah it seems like just going straight up no poo and not washing it with anything doesn't work for my hair cause it gets all greasy and gross.

While talking to her about it, she asked me a question I didn’t have the answer to and was wondering if you guys could help.

“If you don’t use shampoo, how do you actually CLEAN your hair? Isn’t that the same thing as washing your hands without soap?”

This year I switched away from the metal comb and bought a hairbrush cleaning tool, with thick plastic bristles. This doesn't go between as effectively as the comb, but if I brush the surface of the brush, it gets nearly all of the smaller hairs that don't come off by hand, and it loosens the dust for the final stage... which is an electric duster (meant to replace compressed air cans for cleaning the computer).

So the hairbrush cleaner, plus air-blast approach seems to be working okay for me as a daily cleaning solution, with occasional deep cleaning by dental pick... it feels ridiculous to put so much thought/effort into maintaining a hairbrush, but when I slack off on it, I end up removing dust tangles from my hair... not to mention using a hairbrush that looks like the inside of a vacuum bag... *sigh*",NoPoo

I wash my hair once every 1.5 weeks with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, but I am trying to extend these stretches and eventually transition to no-poo. I do not wet my hair between washes. I also have an extremely sensitive scalp, and I had sebborheic  dermatitis and exczema as a child, which I grew out of. 

I am fairly certain I have hard water and am aware that water only is not an option for me. At about the 1 week mark of no washing, my scalp becomes extremely sensitive and painful to the touch, and I can barely tie it up or even part it. I have tried brushing my hair with a natural bristle brush as well as massaging my scalp with my fingertips, but it hurts so bad I can barely do more than a few minutes before I have to stop.

I use aloe vera twice a week overnight and rinse with apple cider vinegar (acv). Any other time in the week that I need to get rid of any oily hair (doesn’t happen often) I rinse with acv. 

I still blow dry and straighten with a hot brush. 

I also brush my hair every morning and night with a boar bristle brush for about 5 minutes. My shoulder length hair is growing fast, and the hair I lost from the SD seems to be growing back. 

I color my hair to cover grays, and the color doesn’t sting my scalp any longer and since I’m a redhead and color red/auburn, it’s no longer brassy. My hair takes the color and it’s a beautiful auburn that looks so natural no one can tell I’ve colored even5 minutes after I’m done.

I wash about twice a week with about 1/2-1 tsp baking soda and rinse with a splash of white vinegar. I felt like my hair was doing great - until I took a bath a week ago, which is something I don't usually do. I did my normal wash routine but in the bath (there was no soap in the water). Afterwards, I put a small pump of argon oil in my wet hair as it was feeling a bit dry. I then proceeded to get about 4 inches cut off my hair.

I didn't let the stylist use any products on my hair. But after it dried my hair was - well, it's hard to describe. Almost sticky?..I can't run my fingers through it anymore. And, overall, it's just looking bleh. 

I thought maybe somehow washing it in the bath messed it up (I have no idea how, but just trying to make some sense of it!).

6078,t3_axo86g,"Hey all, I've been basically shampoo free for about 9 years. I wanted to offer some thoughts and advice, because I have seen lots of posts by people just starting, or who have done it for a year or two, but not much from people like me, who've done it many years.

First, my qualifications. I first heard of the notion of not using shampoo a long time ago, and thought it made sense, so figured I'd try it. Worst case scenario it didn't work and I'd go back to shampooing every other shower. It did work, and I haven't stopped. I've had everything from shoulder length hair to buzz cut, so I have experience with varying lengths.

I say I've been basically shampoo free, because I will still occasionally use shampoo. I do a lot of projects, woodworking, tinkering on my old lawn tractor, brickwork/masonry, and other messy hobbies. Every once in a while, my hair gets too dirty for just water, and I will use shampoo. I have used shampoo probably no more than 4-6 times in the past 9 years. I am not opposed to using shampoo when it is needed, I just am not using it on a constant basis.

My routine is straightforward. I don't have extremely oily hair, which may be from not using shampoo for so long. I generally shower every 2-4 days on average, depending on the weather and my activity level. Summer I may shower every day, in winter when I'm not leaving the house, it may be 4-5 days. I know, that is along stretch to go between showers. I'm a stay-at-home dad of four young kids, and some weeks I don't do enough to warrant showering more often. I smell myself before my wife does, and she tells me if she ever smells me. Don't judge...

Anyway, when I shower, usually in the evening, I get my head under the water and scrub my hair and scalp with my fingernails. I use my nails to exfoliate my scalp, and use my fingers to wash out anything that might have gotten in my hair. I'm not talking about scratching my scalp till it hurts or bleeds, just giving it a good scalp massage/scratch. When I get out, I towel dry, and will give it a quick comb if it's long enough. That's it. No egg yolks, mayo, yogurt, baking soda, vinegar, etc...

Now, I've seen a lot of posts saying their hair is 'oily', and I'm not really sure what the posters mean. When I run my hands through my hair, there will be a slight feeling of oil on my hands. That is normal. That is what hair does. It makes some oil to protect the hair shafts from drying out, and keep the hair healthy and voluminous. We want that oil, which is why we stop stripping our hair with shampoo.

It is very similar to the coating of oil on a cast iron pan. If you are unfamiliar with this notion, it is like this. After using a cast iron pan, you want to put a thin coating of oil on the iron to protect the pan. Most people will pour a little oil in the pan, then use a paper towel to wipe out the excess oil. When finished, there are not pools of oil in the pan, just a nice, even, thin sheen. If you rub your palm across the pan, your palm will also have a thin coating of oil. Thin enough that you could probably just rub it in your hands like lotion and it would disappear.

Similarly, if you run your hands through your hair, you will feel a small amount of natural oils on your fingers. To me it feel like that very last bit of lotion that gets trapped between your fingers, and you have to get your thumb or other fingers down at the base to get it out. That's what my hands feel like after running my fingers through my hair, and that is not 'oily hair' that is natural hair.

I do not generally need hair products, gels, hair spray, or the like, because generally my hair is short enough I don't need it. When I do need it though, I will use it. I don't change my routine to get it out either. I may spend just a few more minutes washing my hair to get it all out. Generally though, natural hair shouldn't be bothered by hair products, unless you are using them to excess.

If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer as best I can.

TLDR: I've been doing this a long time, you (frankly) probably don't need many of the ""alternatives"" that are pushed, and some oil in your hair is normal and nothing to be worried about.",NoPoo

6080,t3_axl8uv,"Hi! I've been happily no poo for over 2 years now. I use Hesh powders (Aritha, Shikakai, Amla, Brahmi and Rose) to clean my hair once a week, then put coconut oil on regularly to moisturise.

However they have a couple ingredients I'm not sure about Cetyl alcohol and BTMS. I've googled them and they seem harmless but I wondered if anyone had any more information or opinions on these ingredients. I wouldn't want to ruin the progress I've made with my hair but I could do with some more hydration.

I am not thinking about giving up, though. I'm going to continue with this, as my hair looks better overall, has less split ends and the maintenance is the cheapest ever.

Recently I was made aware how damaging both 1) washing your hair every day, and 2) the amount of chemicals in these products can be to your hair.

On top of this, I have sobria on my face (my whole family has it, even though all of our diets are very different), so my skin is already extremely dry. I’ve had to put aveeno lotion on my face every day to stop peeling/redness. Since I grew a short beard, with these dry skin problems it means I’m also battling endless beard dandruff/flakes, Which I am able to keep at bay most of the time by rubbing aveeno into the skin beneath my beard. (I’ve tried beard oils, and mixing coconut oil products with Argan oils and have not found anything that has worked besides aveeno).

I am a female with hair almost to my butt, definitely at my waist. My hair type is pretty much straight and fine, though I have a lot of hair. I am Polish, so I have the typical dark blonde/light brown color naturally that is getting darker with the oiliness--which I don't mind! My question is, on day 11 of water only, how much longer can I expect to have such nasty oily hair? It isn't terrible, I can pull it off with my hair in a bun or low pony tail, but the color change combined with the added weight is making it obvious. I'm down to power through it, but I would like to hear form others who had similar experiences how long this phase lasted.

AM: 

\-slept with hair in a long plait/braid, used wide tooth comb to get any knots out

\-used boar brush with my head flipped over, then did an extra pass on my ends to make sure the oil gets down the long length

\-put it in a bun because I look like a sea monster

PM:

\-shower with a cap on

\-same brush routine as the AM, but I spritz a tea tree/peppermint essential oil toner (that I made) on my scalp to keep the flakes and funk at bay (I'm really happy with how this is working out)

\-usually braid it or toss it into a topknot to sleep

\-LAST NIGHT ONLY: did a water only rinse for the first time, my hair seemed like it was drying well then I put it in a bun when it was 90% dry (hoping for some easy waves in the morning, when I used shampoo this was my go-to), when I woke up my hair was noticeably less oily looking.

I heard finasteride helps with hair loss but has bad side effects like ED/limp dick.  I also heard Rogaine works great but if I stop I'd lose the hair grown from it within 3-6 months.  So I'm left with using no poo ""shampoo"", a shampoo that helps with hair loss and a conditioner recommended from /r/nopoo.


I have noticed my hair thinning about 4 years ago and recently my hair growth is half of what it used to be.  I have no family member with baldness so I don't think I'm getting thinning hair from genes.  I'm hoping cleaning my hair with no poo shampoo, a shampoo for hair loss and conditioner that isn't bad for my scalp/hair would do the trick in getting my hair back but like I said my hair loss/thinning hair has been noticeable since 4 years ago.

And I'm just curious is it ok for me to wash my hair with only water on days I don't use a shampoo or wash my hair with the no poo shampoo everyday?  I work at a job that has a high chance of making me sweat and if I don't wash my hair then it smells terrible, like a heavy oily smell.",NoPoo

I live in London and I walk to work pretty much everyday, and I feel as though the pollution is ruining my hair in a way that after I brush my hair (with a wooden brush) there's a black buildup on the bristles and it looks nasty.

Hey there,

So I recently came across lots of posts about people's journeys and I thought I'd actually contribute, since certain groups of us run into the same problems and it's also nice to hear what others think and to have direct advice. Since I'm new to this subreddit, let me know if I should correct anything (format, etc.)

Hair: shoulder-length, straight and very dark (Asian), on the finer side but I do have a lot of it, so I have a pretty full head of hair. 

I tried giving up on shampoo a few years back and used a honey/ cinnamon mix once every week. My hair was so dead and grey that I gave up after 6 weeks and tried using a natural shampoo bar that was also meant to be used once a week, but it felt waxy and didn't change the fact that my hair felt dense and heavy, and there was a lot of build-up. This was all due to hard water, and since I didn't want to invest in a filter, I just went back to cheap and crappy shampoo.

Due to me picking up a sport, I started washing my hair every day, and I knew it was so bad for it. Bear in mind that my hair has always looked okay on the outside. The only aesthetic issue I had was that, due to all the washing, my hair would get so greasy very quickly. Then I started to think about how much I was wasting as well as the fact that constant shampooing is genuinely something that was recently deeply drilled into us as a necessity, when in fact (in the greater scheme of things) it isn't. 

So, I decided to try again.

Firstly, I slowly cut down the length of time between washes (every other day for 2 weeks, every 3 days for 2/3 weeks, twice a week for 2 weeks, then I stopped)

1st 2 weeks of no poo: green tea to ""scrub"" my scalp and hair, followed by black tea as a rinse (I think I read somewhere that the former was alkaline and the latter acidic and I thought I could achieve a 5.5ish pH balance) and just normal hard water to wash it out at the end.

This was perfectly good, since I used a boar bristle brush every night, that I also regularly cleaned. I washed my hair twice a week and it still had a good amount of volume. However, there was still build-up in my hair and towards the end of the second week, my hair started getting dense and grey again.

Very unhappy, I looked into managing that and found that making my acidic rinse more acidic (with lemon juice) should help. And it really did! My hair is no longer waxy, but on the other hand it is far too conditioned; it gets oily really quickly (within a day), though the oil is well distributed throughout the hair. So I reduced the amount of lemon (1 squeezed lemon in about 700ml of black tea instead of two), and this is my third day of oily hair, but oily in a manageable sense.

At the moment, I don’t really want to buy a water filter for my showerhead, but I do use my parents’ filter jug and then boil the water for the tea. Do you think I should go back to limiting the amount of days between washes gradually, or that I should reduce the amount of lemon in the black tea? Also, is saltwater (I use dead sea salt solution to treat my eczema) good for making hair a less oily? Or will that also encourage your scalp to overproduce?

Though I had a bit of a hiccough with the hard water, I do really believe that the lemon helped a huge amount. My boar bristle brush has barely any grey fluff/ waxy bits from brushing my hair, and I feel like my hair is at least evenly oily, instead of greasy at the roots and dry at the ends.

When it comes to how my hair looks, a couple of people have commented on how it looks healthier, but bear in mind that this no poo journey is the only time I’ve properly cared for my hair. From about 12 until 20, I didn’t even own a hairbrush (though my hair was midway down my torso at one point) and I never cared about how it looked, other than if it was too greasy – so I never, ever used conditioner, though in hindsight that probably would have made my head less oily. So now that I brush my hair daily, of course I’m crazy glad not to find my hair everywhere at home, but I don’t know if I’m just shedding it all into my brush, given that I never used to brush my hair. Also, even though I used to dye and bleach my hair a lot, I refused to use a hairdryer out of principle (my mum keeps telling me that going outside with wet hair will give me a cold, so I’ve been doing it in even -5 Celsius just to prove her wrong – successfully, may I add), so I don’t think my hair was that damaged beforehand.

I just really hate how we’ve been tricked into believing that shampoos are this giant necessity and then we go through our entire adult lives forced to shell out money and contribute to waste to avoid having “dirty” hair. Even if the no poo thing doesn’t work out in the long run, I really hope never to go back to washing my hair more than twice a week, and definitely not every day!

tl; dr: Asian hair, no poo with hard water for 3 weeks, at first using green tea followed by black was fine, but it did nothing for my build-up and so I added lemon juice to the black tea and now my hair gets greasy very easily, albeit evenly so and at least without the nasty waxiness from hard water.

6110,t3_au3irp,"Hey. I'm about 9 days into WO (water only). I have very dense and thick wavy hair, about bob length, no color treatment.
My crown is pretty oily, but the rest of my hair is starting to feel very soft. I do get a little bit of static lift on the ends, however.
I brush in all directions, about 100 strokes every night. I have only washed twice thus far, both times soaking in a bath in the hopes that some of my flakes will float free, and then followed with a shower and COLD rinse to seal the cuticle.

A few questions:
1. I don't understand how to clean my boar bristle brush. It looks DISGUSTING after I brush; ashy and waxy.
2. I have a lot of flakes that will not come out of my hair. I ""scritch and preen"", but it just seems to make more. I cannot tell if it is dandruff or dry scalp because the flakies stick to my sticky, oily hair. How do I get rid of them?
I had this problem when I did regular washing before, and even when I shaved my head I still had flakes!
I have tried ACV rinse, and always felt as if it never came out of my hair completely. Like it was a layer or something. 
3. My hair stinks; it smells dirty. Will this go away as I keep up the regimen?

6119,t3_assc8e,"Hey all, I've been basically shampoo free for about 9 years. I wanted to offer some thoughts and advice, because I have seen lots of posts by people just starting, or who have done it for a year or two, but not much from people like me, who've done it many years.

First, my qualifications. I first heard of the notion of not using shampoo a long time ago, and thought it made sense, so figured I'd try it. Worst case scenario it didn't work and I'd go back to shampooing every other shower. It did work, and I haven't stopped. I've had everything from shoulder length hair to buzz cut, so I have experience with varying lengths. 

I say I've been basically shampoo free, because I will still occasionally use shampoo. I do a lot of projects, woodworking, tinkering on my old lawn tractor, brickwork/masonry, and other messy hobbies. Every once in a while, my hair gets too dirty for just water, and I will use shampoo.  I have used shampoo probably no more than 4-6 times in the past 9 years. I am not opposed to using shampoo when it is needed, I just am not using it on a constant basis. 

My routine is straightforward.  I don't have extremely oily hair, which may be from not using shampoo for so long.  I generally shower every 2-4 days on average, depending on the weather and my activity level.  Summer I may shower every day, in winter when I'm not leaving the house, it may be 4-5 days. I know, that is along stretch to go between showers. I'm a stay-at-home dad of four young kids, and some weeks I don't do enough to warrant showering more often.  I smell myself before my wife does, and she tells me if she ever smells me. Don't judge...

Anyway, when I shower, usually in the evening, I get my head under the water and scrub my hair and scalp with my fingernails. I use my nails to exfoliate my scalp, and use my fingers to wash out anything that might have gotten in my hair. I'm not talking about scratching my scalp till it hurts or bleeds, just giving it a good scalp massage/scratch. 
When I get out, I towel dry, and will give it a quick comb if it's long enough. That's it. No egg yolks, mayo, yogurt, baking soda, vinegar, etc...

Now, I've seen a lot of posts saying their hair is 'oily', and I'm not really sure what the posters mean. When I run my hands through my hair, there will be a slight feeling of oil on my hands. That is normal. That is what hair does. It makes some oil to protect the hair shafts from drying out, and keep the hair healthy and voluminous. We want that oil, which is why we stop stripping our hair with shampoo.  

It is very similar to the coating of oil on a cast iron pan. If you are unfamiliar with this notion, it is like this. After using a cast iron pan, you want to put a thin coating of oil on the iron to protect the pan. Most people will pour a little oil in the pan, then use a paper towel to wipe out the excess oil. When finished, there are not pools of oil in the pan, just a nice, even, thin sheen. If you rub your palm across the pan, your palm will also have a thin coating of oil. Thin enough that you could probably just rub it in your hands like lotion and it would disappear. 

Similarly, if you run your hands through your hair, you will feel a small amount of natural oils on your fingers. To me it feel like that very last bit of lotion that gets trapped between your fingers, and you have to get your thumb or other fingers down at the base to get it out. That's what my hands feel like after running my fingers through my hair, and that is not 'oily hair' that is natural hair. 

I do not generally need hair products, gels, hair spray, or the like, because generally my hair is short enough I don't need it.  When I do need it though, I will use it.  I don't change my routine to get it out either.  I may spend just a few more minutes washing my hair to get it all out. Generally though, natural hair shouldn't be bothered by hair products, unless you are using them to excess. 

If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer as best I can. 

TLDR: I've been doing this a long time, you (frankly) probably don't need many of the ""alternatives"" that are pushed, and some oil in your hair is normal and nothing to be worried about. ",NoPoo
6120,t3_asrhir,"I went no 'poo a few years ago, in my late 20s, and immediately jumped straight to the bs/acv method. This worked for a couple years and then my hair went...bleh. I've always had very long hair (sometimes I can sit on it, though now I keep it more waist-length), average thickness (my braid is not quite as wide as my wrist, if that helps) and very soft. But with the baking soda once a week and boar bristle brushing every night, it wound up impossibly dry and unmanageable right after washing, passable the next day and downhill greasy the rest of the week. Even coconut oil wasn't helping. 

I switched back to shampoo, using sulfate-free ones with 'cone-free conditioners. I've tried several times in all this to go water only, the usual method being to gradually top the shampoo bottle with water. This always works great until I've used up the very last of the suds, then no amount of standing under the water and scrubbing and brushing does anything. My hair takes hours to dry on its own, anyway, and I usually give up and hit it with the blowdryer just to confirm what I already knew: the hard water left it greasy and waxy. On the rare occasions I've been somewhere with soft water, like on vacation, I've had the same grease problem without the wax. I'm currently using Carol's Daughter, which is price-y, but the results are great. 

I still follow my conditioner up with a rinse made of ACV and distilled water to remove buildup, but can't go more than 3 days without washing. I've also tried WO with ACV and still had the greasy problem. 

Now, I'm a full-time, stay-at-home aunt (for a sister who works at a daycare she can't afford), and I've been using my toddler niece and nephew for hair experiments since I'm invariably the one available at bath time. Previously, they'd both been using a hypoallergenic sulfate shampoo twice a week and a bit of my 'cone free vo5 conditioner, but one day I decided to go water only. 

Results: Niece, age 4, who has very fine shoulder-length hair with a slight wave, is able to up to a week without even rinsing, and it still doesn't look greasy. ACV, however, leaves it a bit limp. 

Nephew, age 2, extremely thick curly hair that hangs to his shoulders when wet is also able to go a week between rinses, ACV once a month helps combat any small amount of buildup that might be hiding in there and keeps his scalp smelling fresh. 

Again, we have hard water but neither of them are having any problem staying clean. Is this just an age thing because I started it so early on them and it's just too late for me, or is there some other trick I haven't tried?

I have been reading a lot if posts about dandruff/flakes/dry and itchy scalp/ Seborrheic dermatitis and even hearing IRL from friends and family. I decided to make this post so it could help others too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I was diagnosed with  Seborrheic dermatitis 4-5 years ago and it was BAD! I tried everything - prescription strength shampoo, drugstore shampoo, natural remedies like ACV, lemon juice etc, monistat anti-fungal cream, 8-9 kinds of oils, washing hair daily, washing hair weekly, shampoo bars etc. You get get the idea. 90% of these remedies did nothing, the other 10% worked but either left my hair as dry as a straw or stopped working after a few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I was utterly desperate and mentioned my problem to my massage therapist in Jan 2018. I have TMJ and get medical massage for head/neck/jaw area and I was super embarrassed to go to my therapist and have her rub her hands all over my nasty scalp. I told her about my problem and requested that she use gloves. She then mentioned that she studied Rosemary in her natural healing class and people swore by it.

 Being desperate, I tried it as instructed by her and voila! It worked! Instructions below.

1. Buy dried rosemary (online or whole foods).
2. Bring 3 cups of filtered water to a boil.
3. Add 2-3 tsp rosemary, preferably in a teabag/stainless steel tea ball thingy and reduce to the heat to a simmer.
4. Simmer the tea/rinse for 20-30 min.
5. Turn off the stove and let the rosemary steep, covered, for a few hours (optional for max efficacy).
6. Remove the rosemary and transfer the liquid to a spray bottle for easy application. Please use an amber/dark blue glass bottle (cheap on Amazon) to safely store the volatile oils/compounds in the rinse.

How to use: Use it all the time until you get rid of the flakes.

1. I use as a pre-wash treatment - spray all over scalp and hair liberally. It should saturate the scalp especially. I wait 30-60 min or even overnight depending oh how well I plan my day.
2. I also use it as a post-wash rinse - pour the rinse all over the hair in the shower post-wash as the final step. Rinse with water.
3. I also use it as leave-in - spray the scalp liberally and lightly on the hair after you get out of the shower on damp hair.
4. I use as needed on dry hair if I feel itchy. Simply spray on scalp and leave in.

FYI - I double the recipe and store in the fridge with a couple spoons of vodka in the rinse as a mild preservative. It usually keeps for 2 weeks.

I have been doing this for a year and my scalp is so healthy and flake-free. I did a very intensive daily treatment for 2 weeks to get my scalp under control and now I am at maintenance - usually a weekly application. The other great thing is the side-effects have been all positive - less frizz, skin looks fab because I usually also spritz my face with it. 

I bought a large 1 LB bag of organic Rosemary from Mountain Rose Herbs a year ago (no affiliation) and I still have a ton left. I am thrilled. This solution is so cheap, easy and safe. 

Variations: After telling everyone about this, my friends and family have reported back with their own recipes and all of them have worked well. See below:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Using fresh rosemary also works great. My friend lives in a warm climate and grows rosemary all year round in her yard. 
2. Not simmering or steeping - my cousin lives in a dorm at college and doesn't have a stove to do this. She simply microwaves water in large mug, adds the rosemary and tosses the tea bag 10-15 min later. She doesn't transfer it to a bottle either, she just dumps the entire mug on her head in the shower. 
3. The quantity is very forgiving - some use less/more. Still works.

Anyway, I hope this helps someone. Buy a small packet and try it. As mentioned above, I got a proper diagnosis for SD from a dermatologist, who funnily enough, laughed at this cure when I asked her before trying. Oh well, just happy it worked for me.

6143,t3_aoydry,"### My routine:
I use water only, cold when I'm in a place with hard water and hot when I'm somewhere with soft water (or somewhere with hard water that doesn't cause hair problems – more on this below). I scrub my hair and scalp pretty vigorously for a few minutes, as if I were using shampoo. I wash my hair like this every day. I don't use a brush or comb at all. My hair is short (&lt;1-5""). I've been doing water-only for about 4 years.

I eased into water-only by slowing using more and more ""natural"" hair products over the course of a few years. So I used normal shampoo -&gt; natural shampoo -&gt; baking soda -&gt; water only + occasional shampoo/baking soda to deal with hard water -&gt; water only. I never had a transition phase.

### Hard water
Hard water contains various, depending on region, dissolved minerals. The dissolved minerals bind to sebum to make really unpleasant sticky, white, waxy buildup. It can make your hair feel and look stiff and wet. It's not clear which minerals cause these problems (although my best guess is calcium). I've lived in various places with hard water and only some of them caused the stiffness/stickiness problem.

You should be able to look up your water hardness online. Your water utility [US] is required to make water testing data available, which includes info about dissolved mineral content. There are also maps that highlight regions with soft/hard water. However, keep in mind that the cutoff for hard water is subjective. The real measure of water hardness is if your water is causing you any hair problems. If you're rinsing/washing with water only and your hair starts to develop sticky white stuff, then you have hard-enough water.

I've found that this can be alleviated (amazingly!) by washing exclusively with cold water. It really does work :) When I switched to using cold water, my waxy buildup problems went away in a week of washing every day, so, 7 washes. So you should be able to tell in a short period of time whether cold water is working for you.

Sebum melts around 91°F (33°C). I hypothesize that when it melts the dissolved minerals in hard water get trapped and make that sticky white residue. Hence, if you wash with water cooler than 91°F, your sebum won't soften and won't get minerals mixed in with it.

### What you should do
First, see if you actually have this buildup problem with water-only. Like I said above, in my experience there are a lot of places with supposedly hard water that don't cause problems for me (maybe due to high dissolved minerals, but low dissolved calcium?).

If you *do* have buildup problems, you can address it in various ways:

* Wash with cold water.
* Wash with rain water.
* Wash with distilled water, not tap water.
* Use a shampoo or shampoo alternative every once in a while (every 2 weeks-2 months) to take out the mineral buildup, and do water-only for your day-to-day washes.
* Rinse with something acidic (vinegar is popular, lemon juice and citric acid should both work too). (I haven't tried this myself, but some people say it works.)
* Get a water softener system or water-softening shower head (some contain vitamin C that you have to replenish every so often). (I haven't tried this myself, but some people say it works. I've also seen some websites claim that shower heads can't soften water – they don't have enough contact time with it, basically.)

Lastly, if you're just starting off, I wouldn't worry about this stuff right now. Getting through the transition phase is the first struggle. Once that's done, if you're still having hair problems (dandruff, buildup, dryness, etc etc), look into different shampoo alternatives/changes to your routine to address those specific problems. I didn't even realize hard water was a problem until 1.5 years into low 'poo.",NoPoo

Okay backstory: my hair was falling at an alarming rate after shampooing. I had an itchy, scratchy scalp. Insane dandruff! Insane!
I was trying all sorts of oils and shampoos but nothing worked either for the itch/dandruff or for the hairfall. Then i found out about how shampoos rob our scalp of natural oils.

January 8th was the last time i oiled/shampooed my hair.

Now many here are doing only water which i dont think is right. Just Water cant remove grime. I wash my hair two or three times a week. Once with just water. Once an egg mask. I apply 2-3 egg yolks on my scalp and keep for half an hour. Then i rinse with cold water. I also do a yogurt mask once a week. (I told this to someone here earlier and he thought it was a joke, but it’s not.) Hung curd is basically plain yogurt drained of all water. You dont want to apply yogurt without draining the water else it would keep dripping all over your face. You can use a muslin cloth to do that. Apply for 30, wash with cold. Hair feels amazing. Of course, you gotta use plain yogurt not black fucking currant.

Now because of all these organic applications your head might smell a bit so take half a lemon, squeeze it in a bowl and once you’ve rinsed off the mask apply that lemon juice on your scalp. Keep it for a minute and then wash with cold. Think of it like a conditioner. Another great conditioner is onion juice. Will remove any smells and helps with dandruff too. Plus the sulfur in it is supposed to encourage hair growth.

My hairfall has reduced significantly. I’m no longer scratching my head like an idiot. The dandruff is still there but i would say it has gone down by half, at least. One last thing, switch to a wooden comb. Plastic combs generate static while brushing and our hair stick to the teeth and break away. No such problem with wooden combs.",NoPoo

My dry scalp has been awful for a long time, and the dry environment I live in doesn't help. Exfoliating hasn't helped much, and I found most exfoliants needed to be shampooed out so I couldn't use them often anyway. I noticed my scalp behaved better after hair masks so figured adding moisture would be a good idea. I finally decided to try making a small spray bottle with a blend of:

* some fresh aloe gel (none of the yellow juice from the peel, just the clear gel from inside, and I used a leaf's worth so about 2tbsp but I'm going to start buying a pure gel so I don't kill my plant lol, recommendations welcome)
* good, clean witch hazel (a couple ounces or so)
* a bit of water (probably 3 ounces ish)

The exact proportions don't seem to matter much, for my personal results anyway.

After each wash but before applying leave-in conditioners/serums, I shake up the spray, divide my hair, and drench the hell out of my roots/scalp with it, then massage it in a bit. The very first time I used it, it did wonders for my dry scalp starting INSTANTLY! I also realized quickly that it seems to help control oil production, too, and I went from needing to co-wash about three times a week to only needing to do it once a week. That also happened essentially instantly!

I also started spraying it on (more lightly though, sometimes just on the really itchy/flaky areas) every day on dry hair, not just after washes. So far, I have never yet hit a point where this mixture dried heavily or left residue on my head, and I've put on a LOT of it at a time/over days. I have very fine strands, a fair bit of volume but the strands are super fine and get weighed down easily, so I think if this is drying down clean/weightless on me (especially going a week of uses at a time!) then it should probably do so on just about everyone.

I've been using this for about a month now. My dry scalp isn't totally gone but it's radically better than it was, the itching is a million times better, and the oil control benefit has stayed steady. One time when I didn't have aloe I just used the witch hazel, and the oil production stayed low but the flakes were more present; another time I didn't have witch hazel and just used the aloe, and that time the flakes were better but the oil production moved a bit more toward my-old-normal that week. Take from that anecdotal evidence what you will, and invent something that's perfect for you!

I'm really amazed by how easy this is, how well it works, and how cheap it is, and I really wish I'd tried it years ago. I reallyreallyreally hope this idea helps people out there. As far as I'm concerned, this tool should be in everyone's toolbox!",NoPoo

My hair is very fine, and straight. I am white. No dandruff while using shampoo.

* 27 days without touching a shampoo bottle, aaauuugggh. Since then I've been WO, and keeping my hair up in a ponytail on oily days. Which is most of the time.
* Scalp is still in oily phase but seems to have started producing less of it on its own. I'm not sure if I'm imagining it, or if I'm just used to the oiliness by now.
* Scritching **definitely** produces less oil from about two weeks in. First time I scritched, my hair went from completely clean to soaked and gross in less than a minute. Now it doesn't overreact any more.
* I kept thinking I wasn't distributing the oils down to my ends because my ends always felt dry, but after brushing charcoal residue through my hair that one time (to try reduce odor) and finding it completely soaking the brush it became pretty clear that yes, the oils really *do* stick to the brush very easily, and should therefore be sticking to my ends too.
* A week later I discovered ""hair dusting"", a method to reduce split ends without losing length. Found out that my ends aren't dry -- **the feeling of dryness came from split ends**. Dusting them significantly reduced the dry feeling.
* Been having odor problems for ten days. **It's definitely a bad smell.** So I've been WO washing my hair often the last week to try and keep it under control without resorting to charcoal, baking soda or shampoo -- at most I can only reduce it.
* Scalp started itching a week in, went down at about the three week mark.
* Had dandruff from about a week in -- it doesn't flake off the scalp when I scratch it, it's just there. When I see it I dig the BBB out.
* Today I found some tea tree oil spray at Coles so I sprayed my scalp and BBB, and had a good scritch and distributed it through my hair. Still slight smell, but a significant amount was reduced.
* Going to keep up the tea tree each day for the rest of the oily phase. Hopefully, the smell will go when the oily phase does... not looking forward to what I should do if it doesn't. I don't want to wind up having to measure out baking soda/ACV or eggs or whatever it is non-WO no-poo people do; seems to defeat the entire point of going WO if I'm dealing with a huge hassle like that. IDK, I'll cross that bridge when I come to it!
* **Hair is softer**. Like. Really soft. In the last week it's actually been pretty silky.
* **Volume is reduced**. My hair has always been very fine, and never had volume -- I've always relied on shampooing it, and having it dry in certain positions for volume. Without shampoo it's very flat and thin.
* I know I should be grossed out but I find it hilarious that on my oiliest days, I can take out my pony tail and the pony tail will just... stay. These are high ponytails, btw, not nape-of-the-neck ones. It just stays and I can even swish it around and it'll just hold, omfg. I have to actually tousle my hair to get it out.

Wanted to put this forward for more discussion.

The method I'd read about how to wash WO is:

* Scritch
* Preen
* BBB
* Wash hair under shower by scritching scalp under warm water

So basically -- still washing the scalp and getting rid of oils.

But like, has anybody done it /u/weeblewobble82's way -- not just to try and reduce the oiliness during the oily phase, but as a WO habit to maintain post-oily phase? Instead of washing the scalp?

&amp;#x200B;

Like the title says I'm going no poo for the first time in my life. I (18 M) have thick curly hair and Im looking for a healthier curl. I bought maneline's shampoo, and after using for half a week my hair started to become very thick and leathery. I understand the adjustment phase and I have noticed that it feels ""healthy"" however it has so much weight to it, when it dries its just a big bushy mess ( especially If I run my hands through it)

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to know for the other curly hair redditors what your routines are/ what products you reccomend to make a light and free flowing curl that holds its moisture. My hair is also dry as can be 8/10 dryness. I linked the shampoo for those that are curious.

&amp;#x200B;

recently I have tried using and egg yolk to clarify my hair, and that worked really well to make it feel very clean, however it almost feels the same as if I used a shampoo

Routine: I get in the shower ( always look warm) I wet my hair and use a soft tipped scalp brush to massage a small amount of maneline shampoo evenly throughout my hair. I let that sit for 2-3minutes and then gently rinse it out while running my hands through it. I then either air dry or use a pillow case to slowly rub my hair dry. more recently I used a yolk to rinse out build up in my hair.

Goals: solid routine to get defined curls with minimal frizz. Going for soft flowing hair as well.

TLDR: looking for a good routine to get free flowing curl that holds its moisture. what products or home remedies do you recommend?

Been no-poo consistently for about 7 years now, currently using African Black soap. So cheap, use it for my body and my hair, and it's wonderful. I make it softer with coconut oil or my beauty store mango styling gel that has jojoba oil and the like in it. 

I've got black, coarse Asian hair, so not sure how much my methods would help people, but I really just went cold turkey. One of the few good things from my mother was her getting me to go no-poo, hence why its been 7 years. Originally, I just used bar soap, and with my short hair it worked. 

Started using black african soap last year, it's really nice and exfoliating. Have to be causeful not to get too sudsy or else it really burns in my eyes. Coconut oil is super good for making my hair soft, but it definitely looks greasy right after I put it on.

Am a guy, so not too concerned about how greasy or stylish I look, I went no-poo to save money and convenience. Gonna be no-poo for rest of my life probably, as it works well for me. ",NoPoo

The recipe starts with you mixing

° Rye Flour and Water

The ratio to mix it is 1:2 ( for every spoon of rye flour you add 2 spoons of water )

° Mix it fully until a liquid paste forms

° When washing leave it for a few minutes and then rinse until clean

° After that use Apple Cider to avoid dryness 

° At the end use a brush to remove any of the flour that is still on the hair

6196,t3_agwd6k,"I've always liked the idea, but am not convinced about the reality. I've been co-washing for a while and that's been working well, but would like to full on commit to water only.

However, I'm not convinced about the scientific basis of no poo. From what I've read, most proponents state that scalp starts producing less oil as it gets ""used"" to not being stripped of grease every few days. TBH, to me this sounds questionable (don't take this as an attack, I just think it's good  to challenge stuff). How would the skin cells and the hair follicle even monitor sebum levels?

**Is there any actual peer reviewed research into this, and where did the idea come from in the first place?**

Even if there's not and even if the above theory is wrong, that's less important than whether no poo works even for another reason.

Which brings me to question 2. All you people who have really nice hair from no poo; Is it actually ***nicer*** than when you used shampoo and conditioner, about the same, or worse but still fine? Because one of my friends has been ""no pooing"" for 6 years or so, and her hair looks fine. But it still sometimes looks a little waxy and greasy (especially now it's longer). So is your hair better than it was before? Or is no poo just a low maintenance way for hair to look OK.

Would super appreciate any insight!

On the website, they suggest doing a ACV rinse after using the shampoo bar.

Our plumbing in the house we are renting backs up if you look at it wrong, and the tub took a loooong time to drain out today.

To avoid shoving flour down our sensitive drain all the time, I was thinking about making some sort of tea. Like soak or cook the flour and use the liquid and not the solid. Do any of you do this? Cold soak or hot infusion? Do you put it on your head all watery or do you reduce it down to a thicker consistency? Do you feel it cleans as well as actual rye flour?

I feel like hot would get more of the good good out but my hair is loving the protein and I don't want to disturb the protein structures in the rye flour with heat. Also...would the water even have protein in it? I have doubts about it because of fake meat. Old school recipes for making seitan (a meat replacement) involve washing wheat flour in water. Repeated exposure to water removes any gluten until only the protein remains. Would this also be an issue? Like, would rye water be everything but the protein I want?

6228,t3_ad7uyy,"Hey NoPoo

I've been currently without soap about 3+ years now, using exclusively cold water on my hair for about a year. 

My guide to surviving the cold:
Start warm, but don't rinse your hair with hot water. ONLY use cold water in your hair. Warm water opens pores in your hair, allowing more adsorption of oils. Only using cold water will shock your hair, freeing oils more than usual. Water will get most of the oil out, and any excess should be taken up in a healthy amount once your hair warms up. When you scrub, rinse your hands often. NoPoo is a physical cleaning method and reducing oils on your hands makes it more effective. Use water as cold as you can go. It'll be rough at first, but if you stay consistent you'll get used to it. Cold showers are honestly very refreshing. 

As far as frequency, everyone is different. It will depend on your activity levels and experience with no shampoo. Pay attention to what you do each day and find what works. Personally, I will at least wet my hair daily but not necessarily scrub. 

If the cold is hard, start hot, alternate to cold when washing your hair, then back to warm before your toes fall off. But, ONLY cold water in your hair. Any amount of hot water can result in greasy hair at the end of your shower. 

Good luck, learn to love the cold. Cold showers are one of the best things I've found for energy, mental health, and immune system promotion.

The front half of my hair looks and feels pretty okay. I've got a shit load of dandruff though and the back of my hair is nasty and greasy. The individual hair strands are kinked and jagged. But I've never once dyed or treated my hair. I've straightened it maybe twice in my life and I occasionally blow dry it on warm, never hot. The water at my house is a bit hard so I have a water softener in the shower. Right now, I'm using a no poo bar and an acv rinse every so often.

- Juice from 1 lemon
- About a tsp Cinnamon

Place in a jar and let ferment on the counter for 1-2 days, then move to the fridge. After eating the apples, I dumped about a half cup of the 'brine' in my hair and worked it like shampoo.

What I came across recently is that some are doing the same thing with their entire body--which is, going soap-less.

I mean I would usually run a soapy washcloth between my cheeks a few times and then rinse. But I mean, I don't know.

How are you doing today?

So, I got some skin and hair problems ever since I can remember. When I was younger I didn't really care about hygien and it turns out that I grew up with a lot of pimples, blackheads and dandruff. 
This year when I decided to cut my long hair I realized that I was balding, and this process improved really fast through this year, it's terrifying. 
As you all probably know, commercial anti dandruff shampoos and skin care medicine didn't work at all. I went to the dermatologist and she said that I'm balding thanks to a condition called ""Dermatitis Seborrheic"", in other words my glands works too much, my body gets too oily and due to the lack of proper skin care it turns to be a really big problem. After researching I realised that it wasn't worth to take any of the tons medicine she asked me to buy and take - first because it's too expensive; second because they wouldn't solve the problem, just addict me (like anything in health industry nowadays). 
I decided to start taking cold showers and I am already used to it. I don't use any shampoos, but use conventional soaps to wash my body and head. After taking a shower, I apply apple cider vinegar and a tea of nettle, rosemary and cinnamon on my scalp and leave it. It works pretty good, my scalp isn't itching too much and no dandruff, but if I don't take a bath everyday the dandruff comes again and start itching a bit, but it isn't as bad as it used to be. 
I am trying a new diet, cutting the junk food as much as I can and taking vitamins and care more about nutrition. I also stated working out. 
PS: I'm just 18, that's why I am terrified.

Some background info: I have been low-poo for four years, using Dr. Organic Aloe Vera once a week. I have shoulder-length hair, straight and I would say it’s very healthy (no split ends and hardly ever dry).

I’ve been washing with baking soda and rinsing with ACV (mixed with water) about twice a week, and using Badger brand hair oil mixed with rose water as a leave-in conditioner, all for about six months. 

My problem is that my hair looks like garbage every morning after I sleep on it, and the only surefire way to make sure it looks nice every day is by FULLY rinsing or washing. This is true whether I air dry or blow dry. If I rinse and let air dry, I have wet hair for the first half of the day, which doesn’t work when I work mornings. It’s very easy for it to become frizzy after air drying. If I mist with a spray bottle after waking up, my hair ends up frizzy beyond acceptability whether or not I run my fingers through; like, I may as well not have bothered.

If I have blow dried it smooth the previous day, then I wake up to cow licks that I can’t smooth out, even with a boar bristle brush. The brush may flatten the cowlick, but the ends of my hair will stay wavy, creating an equally weird texture that I end up wanting to pin back; again, why bother trying if I’m just going to cover it up?

When I was a naive youth, I used to wash and blow dry my hair EVERY SINGLE DAY for this reason. It has always been a challenge to make my hair look nice from day to day, and I’m tired of constantly cutting it short. I miss having a bob/longer hair, so I’m growing it out again with the hope that I will be able to treat it better this time around and keep it nice looking, and also that I’ll at least be able to pull it into a bun on days when I don’t have time to fuss with it. Still, I just wanna be pretty some days! 

So, now that I have some length again...does anyone with a similar hair type have any suggestions for everyday styling for fine curls when daily rinsing is not an option?

(I have very long, straight brown hair, slightly damaged at the ends from not cutting it)
I was getting a lot of waxy build up, in retrospect I possibly should have rinsed with acv, but I was hoping it would work itself out. 

Here I was plaiting my hair into two plaits to disguise the ickyness, when I met a nice enough guy (who happened to also be very sexy) at a music festival.

When he asked me out on a second date, I was worried that he would be noticing my hair, so I got my old trusty shampoo and gave it a double wash and threw on a nice dress. (Actually, I think we went to make a picnic breakfast by a stream, so it was probably shorts and t-shirt with a bikini underneath..I regress...)

I assume we don't have hard water because we have a whole house water softener but have never tested our water.  

My hair is thin and was 2C/3A with my old ways but has been much more straight since giving up conventional shampoo. (The exact opposite of what I had hoped for.)  

My current routine:  I wash with my shampoo bar, currently using ""Simply Shea"" by Apple Valley, and follow up with an ACV &amp; water rinse.  I've also started using about a dime size amount of conditioner in the ends of my hair along with an even smaller amount or Argan and Jojoba oils. On wash day my hair can have a lot of fly-aways and may even look frizzy.   Day 2 is hit or miss; sometimes my hair looks fine and other times my roots begin to look greasy.  By day 3 my roots are noticeably greasy.   Sometimes  I just braid it and deal, other times I use a homemade dry shampoo (corn starch and cocoa).   By day 4 I really struggle with whether to shampoo again or not. Sometimes the dry shampoo will get me 2 extra days, sometimes only 1 day.  I do notice that I can go a bit longer before my roots get greasy if I skip the ACV rinse.  I do have 2 boar bristle brushes that I've tried using.  It doesn't seem to make a huge difference and I'm not sure the oils are getting to the ends of my hair?  It's also been pretty rough on my curls.

I tried going water only but getting my hair wet seems to make it angry.  Even with lukewarm/cool-ish water it makes my roots immediately look more oily.

After browsing this sub for a few hours I’ve decided to go full on water only and just hope for the best, since I really can’t make my hair worse at this point unless I do something astronomically bad like mistake my nair for my shampoo. 

But both my shampoo and conditioner contain silicones and I fell into the bad habit of basically doing scritch and preen with both my shampoo and conditioner because I thought it would make my hair extra clean and extra moisturized, so I’m positive I’d experience bad results unless I clarified my hair. 

The only thing I’ve seen to clarify is a silicone free and sulfate containing shampoo and conditioner but I have neither, and I don’t want to go buy some if I don’t have to especially since they would both potentially never be used again. 

I do have Castile soap, if maybe some of that diluted with water would work, but I don’t have anything to condition after. I also have baking soda but no apple cider vinegar, but I have been meaning to buy some so if that’s a good option for clarifying maybe it’d be better to wait a few days until I’ve bought some.

Looking for help and completely sick of my hair becoming greasy halfway through one day. Now I have been Water Only for two weeks running with no real need to use cleansing products at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

To preface, my hair is fine with a slight wave, and there is a LOT of it. I shed like crazy and currently it sits roughly at the bottom of my rib cage.

I always had heaps of trouble with my hair, in high school it was greasy on top with dry and splitting ends. If I washed it in the morning it would 100% be greasy by lunch time. It was infuriating for me. After some time complaining about it, my sisters friend said if I didn't wash it for 3 weeks and then went back to washing it normally it would be HEAPS easier. I thought this was great - in theory. Obviously I knew nothing about sulfates and silicones so it didn't make any difference, just that it was insanely oily for the three week duration.

So I went back to normal for some time, just washing it and dealing with the greasy and oiliness that went along with it. Until one day in my 20's I discovered reddit and this sub. I was so surprised it was an actual thing for people, let alone a possibility for me to maybe get to a point where I wouldn't need to wash my hair so much, which seemed completely unfathomable.

Anyway, I did some research and lurking of this subreddit and of course my first go to was baking soda and vinegar, which absolutely no idea about pH levels I just went ahead and did it. My hair texture changed, it became really thin and straight, it looked great for a while, until the baking soda started burning my scalp. Naturally I flipped and made my way back here for other alternatives, I came across rye flour.

Let me just say, Rye Flour is amaaaaaaazing. So good for you like, once a week, great protein for your hair. But I think I just found for me, it was unsustainable considering the length of my hair. But by this point, sticking to rye flour and especially no longer touching silicone conditioners, the length of time to washing my hair was increasing, bit by bit.

I was really happy, my hair was growing so well and it was great, it honestly still is but as I said, the upkeep with rye flour, the husk and potential damage to my plumbing was concerning for me. So after a few months, I looked to sulfate and silicone free shampoos and conditioners.

In my country, it's not so easily accessible and when you do find it, it is EXPENSIVE. I first tried [this](https://moogoo.com.au/milk-shampoo.html) along with the matching conditioner, it worked well and my hair grew like crazy. After a while though my scalp was getting really dry. I had started to learn a bit more about ingredients in shampoo and conditioner and realised it is full of coconut derivatives, which I don't think my skin agrees very well with. So again, I looked for another alternative.

I then found [this shampoo](https://www.akin.com.au/sensitive--scalp/p/mild-and-gentle-fragrance-free-shampoo-225ml/1310001.html?lang=en_AU#lang=en_AU&amp;start=1). Which is pretty much what I have been using for the past year. It has been so great, even though it's expensive for me, I only use it roughly once a week. It doesn't foam up much, but you don't necessarily need it to. Because of my dry ends, the conditioner was perhaps not enough to help with the splitting, but I changed to the deep conditioner, which easily fixed the issue. Also conditioner only with this product worked really well to my surprise.

Anyway, recently I have been between my two jobs, I start a new one soon. But I got really lazy and didn't wash my hair with anything but water. It's been two weeks and it actually looks really good. The only thing I've recently changed is my hairbrush to one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Brush-Cushion-Bristle-Handle-Brushes/dp/B00898E5O2) which has helped immensely with my split ends.

Anyway, if you're curious to know what gross disgusting foul greasy after half a day hair looks like after literal years of trial and error, to today with two weeks WO, here it is. Remember kids, persistence is key.

6343,t3_9rlxr3,"I have thin hair. My usual routine is to shampoo my hair every other day, and cover it with dry shampoo on days when I don't wash my hair. I recently started using lush bars, which I loved, but then realized they have sulfates, and now I am not sure I want to use them. I also have a giant bottle of livingproof shampoo, which I like. I also normally use a detangler, volumizing spray, heat protector, sometimes I use hair wax, and finish it off with hair spray.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a large forehead, so it is not easy for me to wear my hair up, because my forehead looks giant! Same goes for headbands, etc. I work out a lot, so I don't want to bother with bangs. When I had bangs, I had to wash it every day, and it was thinning out even more, so I gave up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I washed my hair normally as described above on Monday. Then I wanted to go swimming on Wednesday evening, so I didn't want to wash my hair on Wednesday morning, as I would normally do, and instead I just wore it up. It is not normal for me, and I didn't feel good the whole day. 

&amp;#x200B;

On Wednesday night I ended up not going swimming, and instead was reading about this subreddit and checking out some FAQs.I didn't want to have a weird transitioning period, since I am already very concerned about my face and my hair, and having greasy hair is not something I am ok putting up with. 

I already have a boar-bristle brush, so I was wondering, what would happen if I just wash my hair with warm water only, and condition. I was like.. well.. the worst thing that can happen, I will have to wash it again the next day, but it's worth a try. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I washed my hair thoroughly, massaging very well, then applied a tiny bit of conditioner, and made sure I rinse it well. To my surprise, my hair felt very clean, I didn't feel the difference comparing to using shampoo. And if you don't feel the difference, then why use it? I was shocked with the results. I noticed my hair was more shiny, but not oily. I also skipped the detangler (surprisingly my hair didn't feel like straw, so I didn't see the need), skipped the volumizing spray, and everything else. I just dried my hair with a hairdryer, and it felt really good all day. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the evening I swapped my silk pillowcase around to make sure it is clean, and combed my hair with the boar-bristle brush. I went to sleep without braiding my hair (hoping for that magical effect of a silk pillowcase). I brushed my hair thoroughly with the brush, and went to work. This is the first time I went to work with my second-day hair free of any products. I can definitely see reduced volume compared to yesterday, and I am definitely slightly concerned that by the end of the day my hair is going to look oily, but I am hoping for the best. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I just want to share, and if you guys have any tips or comments, feel free.

I learned these are cyclic silicones (or siloxanes) based on a [Naturally Curly article](https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/curlchemist-cyclomethicones-a-different-category-of-silicones) which also includes some mixed messages about build-up, e.g., ""Cyclomethicones... aren't prone to build-up"" and ""[consumer-reported] problems were attributed to build-up on the surface or build-up due to penetration of the smaller silicone into the hair shaft,"" then the author suggests the unfavorable results were due to a different mechanism.  

[Neonatural.com](http://www.nenonatural.com/hair-blog/-water-soluble-vs-non-soluble-silicones-found-in-hair-products) indicates Cyclohexasiloxane is only slightly soluble and Cyclopentasiloxane is not water soluble, indicating these are both likely to contribute to buildup.

The bentonite clay honestly almost seems too good to be true - it leaves my hair soft, de-tangled, and not overly greasy.  Has anyone else been doing this long term?  Are there any risks I should be aware of?  (Other than the fact that it can dry your hair out if you leave the mask on too long).  ",NoPoo
6392,t3_9jtl89,"I've been washing with water only for about 2 years. I heard about No Poo and without really doing any research just decided to stop using shampoo, conditioner or styling products in my hair. I do pretty much nothing to it except rinse it with hot water and towel dry it into a rough messy style. I've always kept my hair pretty short and this process has served me well. However, I've grown it a bit longer now (apparently having newborn twins doesn't leave much time for things like haircuts), and instead of just lopping most of it off, I want an actual hairstyle. If you Google ""male haircut short sides long top"", pretty much any of the image results are what I'd be aiming for.

My problem is that when my hair is a bit longer, it gets kind of fluffy, voluminous and difficult to control. It doesn't *feel* too dry, but it kind of looks it, I guess. I think my individual hairs are quite fine and wiry, I just have a lot of them, if that makes sense. My hair's not curly, but once it gets a bit longer it's also definitely not straight by any measure.

What can I do to tame it into my desired style? I've loved the feeling of not having any wax or gel in my hair and am reluctant to go back to using some kind of styling product, although I'm open to recommendations if that's the way I have to go.

I had been attempting NoPoo for several years with mixed results in the quality of my hair. I'm also quite active and regularly workout and also work in a hospital and am likely colonized by MRSA. 

During this time I developed a true chronic folliculitis in my beard (NOT (pseudo)follicitis barbae). For years I took intermittent and then suppressive doxycycline with some suppression of the follicitis, but never a remission. Retrospectively the time correlation between NoPoo and development of the folliculitis seems pretty clear, but at the time I couldn't attribute a clear cause. I do have a history of acne (requiring accutane) and changing my pillow cases daily seemed a bit helpful but was unsustainable. Ultimately I tried daily shampooing with strong salisylic acid shampoo and have been folliculitis free for months for the first time in YEARS. 

Let this be a cautionary tale that if you are prone to development of comedones (acne) and are likely colonized with MRSA via healthcare work or high-level physical activity/gym going, then NoPoo may result in chronic skin issues.

The hairdresser washed it and holy cow, did it feel nice, smooth, light and just so clean afterwards. I kept playing with my hair the whole day, it was just so nice.

I tried the distilled water and acv today and WOW my scalp feels great, my hair isn’t greasy, and it has volume! Worlds a difference from the greaseball lumpy tangly mess I had when I tried shampoo bars before.

I did more research and found out that hard water leaves build up in your hair which can make your hair feel disgusting. It also doesn’t rinse out. It basically adds chlorine and a load of other crud to you hair. Plus it can cause dandruff, itchy scalp, and eczema. So I’m investing in a $30 water softener shower filter. (Not just a shower filter, it needs to actually soften the water).

Look on YouTube on how to test if you have hard or soft water. This can be done with castille soap/dr bronners and a cup of your shower water. I’m sure there are other methods. Such as just trying out a rinse with distilled bottled water and apple cider vinegar and not washing it out after you rinse.

I've started using micellar water from Garnier occasionally on my face and reading a post from a few months ago I thought I'd see what happened if I used it on my hair.  I used the same amount as I normally use for my clay shampoo, about 1/3 c. and scrubbed it into my scalp.  Immediately I could tell that it was cleaning it really well, perhaps too well.  The water started to get kind of milky colored as it grabbed all the sebum.  I then rinsed it all out and used my normal conditioner so the only thing that changed in my routine was the cleanser.

Results: Not a huge fan. My hair got really tangled after using it and felt way too squeaky clean, this was almost like a sulfate wash.  I would only use this vary rarely as a clarifier.  If however you have a different style hair maybe this would work, or perhaps it could be diluted to give better results.

6454,t3_9bscja,"Hi all.
I've not been able to try out NoPoo as consistently as I would like to. I spent much of the last 3 years with bleached blonde hair. Naturally, my hair is a mid brown, so you can imagine the state it was in. 
About 2 months ago, I decided to stop bleaching, and had my hair dresser put a brown on to cover most of the blonde. I'm planning to not dye or bleach - hopefully never again!
My hair is quite thick, and prone to breakage. My hairdresser told me that moisture is actually the worst thing for bleached hair! Bleach strips the protein out of hair, and adding moisture makes it very weak.
I discovered the power of the natural hair mask today. I mixed up an egg, coconut oil, honey, and a little cocoa powder (to help fight the fade!). I slathered it on, and left it overnight. I've washed it out with a low-poo (no Parabens or SLS). My hair is still drying - but my god it's beautiful.
I've also learned that I should not be using baking soda on my hair right now, because it's pretty good at ripping the dye out!
I hope my little experiment can be helpful to someone. 
I can't wait to try another protein loaded mask in a couple of weeks.

Also I'd like to show some respect and not go there with smelly/greasy hair or hair that is difficult to handle (since it's he that have to work and touch them, being a person that doesn't really like touching other people's hair I may understand his possible concern)

4. **What about the rest of the body?** Since it's still using bath product on the skin, would it be better to stop using them also? I would try and stop using anything on my body (except for toothpaste), but also there I'm afraid about the body odour, as respect for people around me

I'm looking to start my cowashing journey.  I have super fine and thin straight hair.  I've recently had some pretty bad breakage from bleaching, so I'm doing a drastic 180 and putting natural haircare at the top of my list.  I've trimmed off what I can of the breakage and am not going to bleach again.  From what I've read at /r/FancyFollicles basically my only option is to cut off the dead and wait for it to grow out. 

&amp;#x200B;

With so much information out there, I've found a ton of different techniques and conditioners to use.  Right now I'm using Suave Essentials (in a strawberry sent).  I thought that was a safe option but from my research it seems they've changed the ingredients and only the coconut ""flavor"" is the co-wash/no poo approved variety.  **Can I use the rest of this bottle? Or am I better off just going and getting a new bottle?**

&amp;#x200B;

I've read a ton about how you wash on wash day.  What no one really covers is **What does the week look like? Do you cowash everyday? Every 3-4 days?  Do you apply leave in conditioners? If so, do you do that everyday? How does that look?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Most importantly, I work out a lot-- and because of my thin/fine hair sweat basically saturates my entire head.  Due to my breakage I've been just allowing my hair to air dry after exercise (because I've sworn off any hot tools unless I'm going to a formal event or something).  **Will this method work when cowashing? How do I approach sweaty gym hair?** Do I let it dry and then try to comb through any oils? 

Finally, Do you do any additional oils in your hair, maybe at night between washes? **Show me your typical routine for cowashing!**

So last November I decided to finally make the jump and go no-poo. It was something I had been interested in trying for a couple of years but never had the courage to actually do. Here is my story (yea I know I wrote a novel) and my experience, and I hope it helps give a little hope to people just starting out who are struggling.

Starting out, my transition to no-poo was born out of circumstance more than anything. Last fall I made the decision to set up a camp out in the woods on the edge of town and make it my home. I had a rudimentary shower rig but washing up still only happened a couple times a week at most, so I used a BBB in between ""showers"" to try and tame the grease. 

After a month or so had passed and winter was getting close, I decided it was time to return to society so I got an apartment. I decided that even though I was easily able to shower every day, I wanted to keep going down the no-poo road. I researched a little more about Water-Only routines and developed one for myself. 

Every day before I showered and before I went to bed I would scritch my hair really thoroughly and go through it with my BBB. In the shower, I would scritch again while making sure the water was hitting my scalp directly where I was scritching, and move my hair around to help the water rinse out all the dirt and oil. For drying I would simply dab my hair with my towel to get some of the water out and then let it do it's thing. 

It took about 3 months for me to go through the ""transition"" phase until I no longer looked like Kurt Cobain, and now my hair is the healthiest and best-looking it has ever been. It is soo soft and shiny now, and the color even slightly changed! I have always had dirty blonde hair, but before going WO it was more light brown. Now it is waay more blonde and people have noticed. Starting out was pretty tough and I had plenty of moments where I was ready to give up, but now I wouldn't even dream of putting ANYTHING in my hair besides water. 

If you're just starting out and are stuck in the horribly waxy transition, keep going you can do it! The pay-off is definitely definitely worth it. ",NoPoo

I've been using castile soap for over a year, nothing else. The first 8-9 months were great (apart from transition hell). But I'm not happy with it any more as my hair feels increasingly dry. It's also always been greasy and I still have to wash it every day. For a while I could do every other day, but it's back to daily again. I'm not sure what's going on.

I have extremely thin and 'dead' hair. It looks a lot better since ditching shampoo so I won't go back. I just need to change things up.

What would be a good direction to go in? I worry co washing will make my hair look greasy and flat (I avoided conditioner previously as it made my hair that much more flat and lifeless - don't know if it would be any different now?). I'm off put by the baking powder and ACV stuff as I tried it before and it just seems cumbersome and ineffective. I don't mind making my own concoction, but only if I can make a bottle and not need too much effort every day, like cracking open an egg or whatever. If I only had to wash my hair once a week it would be another story. But I need to be able to wash it quickly without too much hassle every day.

My goal is to have healthier hair and be able to wash it less. I'll settle for healthier though. It's getting irritatingly dry!

I read years ago that the straighter and longer your hair is, the harder it is to ditch shampoo. So I'm happy I've managed to at all. But I would *love* to not have it get greasy every day and to wash it less often. I can try another 'transition' period, I just don't trust I'll get results. I'm not sure what to try.

Any suggestions or advice? 

Thank you.

6493,t3_97cb6a,"I've been nopoo and nosoap for a week now. My hair used to puff out and I'd get frizzy flyaways no matter what so I went cold turkey to water only and it calmed down the frizz for sure. I washed once with diluted baking soda but I didn't have any acv on hand so no rinse. It didn't really seem to ""work"" though. It was hard to get my hair totally rinsed and I didn't notice any real difference. I used some older baking soda so maybe that's why?

Anyway my real question. 

I have allergies to smoke and work in a smoky environment. So when I'm at work the smoke kinda gets stuck in my hair and just lingers. I used to just shampoo it out and notice an immediate improvement in my sinuses. Obviously I won't be using shampoo anymore and the baking soda didn't help much, what should I try next? Or will this just resolve itself as my hair and scalp adjust from 30 years of shampoo to no poo.

I'm thinking I'll buy new baking soda, and use the acv rinse after. If that doesn't work, I'll try rye flour. I just want clean hair without poo!! Any suggestions?? ",NoPoo

Right now, I shampoo every other week followed by an ACV rinse and coconut oil in my ends (trying to use up the shampoo I have before I start making my own--unsurprisingly, this is taking forever).  Around the one-week mark, I'm using dry shampoo (corn starch, cocoa powder, EO), qnd my hair honestly looks better after dry shampoo than it does after an actual wash.  I usually wash my hair with cold water in the mornings, though after dry shampoo I don't because it tends to make my hair look greasier.  My hair is a couple of inches past my shoulders, but I also have the sideswept bangs/emo flap thing going on.  As my hair's been getting longer, I can tell that the natural oils have been doing really good things for it.

The bangs/around my scalp is where the greasiness is really noticeable (*especially* the bangs, though).  I usually just clip my hair back to get through this, but the oils in my hair seem to have a certain smell, and it's not pleasant.  The dry shampoo helps some, between the cocoa smell and the EOs I use, but it's just a smell on top of a smell.

However, when I saw videos about it, from people who are part of the moviment for a while, I noticed that they only used water, so, who should I listen, any personal experiences?

I'm having some doubts about this No poo.. well. no.. having doubts about No conditior and need some help.  


I've tried looking at the FAQ and pinned post stuff but on my desk top i can't see the community info.. it's only on my phone and it's really hard to see and go to all the links.  
my hair history.  
 i live in Australia, I have type 2ish hair. but it's super thick. super greek and below shoulder legnth.  
For my life I have only needed to wash my hair once a week or once a fortnight sometimes.  
my hair never gets oily, the only reason i'd actually wash is that after about a week it would get itchy and gunky.  
I am ( was) an avid user of products, due to my hair not being naturally oily i would use a lot of leave in conditioners and oils. it would jsut soak it up, but my hair wasn't ever really dry either except the ends... my hair is in "" good"" condition apart from having all these chemicals in it.  


 recently, I mistakenly have done two washes ( 1 each week) with bi carb prior to doing a last sulphate wash to get rid of the silicones. and used AVC.  the first week was amazing. my scalp never felt so clean, but by the second week my hair was getting very knotty and kinda... elastic? when i'd brush it would spring/stretch/pull and then break. it didn't feel.. like.. good.  
wash ratios i used  was 1 and half TBS bi carb and 2 Cup water.  
ACV 20ml to 320ml water  
last night i did a massive coconut oil left it in untill tonight where i have done my last sulphate wash.  
I rinsed with AVC ( i hope that is okay)  


I am mostly confused about the no conditioner part. I understand that ACV is supposed to replace that part?  
Also what is a replacement for a leave in conditioner? a lot of suggestions are oils.. but that makes my hair look oily?as each time i used oils for the past 2 weeks it made my hair more oily than it used to.   
the oils i used was coconut and teatree ( teatree on account of dandruft)  


am I to just trust that i wont need any conditioner or treatment after a shower eventually?also sometimes i straighten my hair, but i suppose i will have to give up a heat protectant? is there an alternative? will i need to do that anymore considering my hair ""should"" be getting healthier and stronger?  


okay, thats it i think. sorry guys.. and thank you.

Hair: just past the shoulders, thick (in quantity at least), slight wave

Previous routine: washed once a week with supermarket shampoo and conditioner

Motivation: minimalism, reduce plastic, get out of an unnecessary cosmetic consumer cycle. 

Now: 3 weeks no poo, shampoo bar from a farmers market ([riasoap.co.nz](https://riasoap.co.nz)), BBB once so far, soft water  


I'm not sure if my current option is the best long term. My hair is currently very greasy and it's got some white stuff on the BBB last night which I assume is dead skin cells yuck.

I wonder if this has anything to do with no using shampoo? I also do use TIGI bed head hair was almost everyday, not sure if that contributes to anything.

6552,t3_91atml,"So first off I just wanna say that I just ran across a mention of no poo in some AMA comment and decided to give it a go, 3 months later I have no intentions of going back!

When I first started I bought myself a shampoo bar to get through the intial greasy period but to my pleasant surprise I never really had one, so I have just been rocking water only with a board bristle brush and love the way my hair feels.  I'm a 26 y/o white guy, I think my hair is 2A but I'm not entirely confident on that.  It's basically short, thick hair with a slight wave.  Since ditching shampoo I no longer have to use styling product to get my hair to not look like a giant mop on my head, now I only use a little bit if I really want to make sure I have 100% control of it.

My question is that my sister just bought me this dope comb for my birthday which I have been using w/ my BBB.  

[the comb in question ](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/schwarz-manufacturing-co-brass-comb) is made of brass, which is a big part of what makes it so cool but I was just wondering the other day if it has the potential to damage my hair more than a plastic or wooden comb.  My hair is really thick and it always has at least a knot or two which I have to use a bit of force to get through, and I'm a little bit worried the sharper metal teeth could do some harm if I force it through my hair.

I wash my hair twice a week with hair soap and a vinegar rinse afterward - works great, I've been doing it like this for a year. 

However, my hair is super sweaty after exercising, but I don't want to really wash it more often than twice a week. I've tried just rinsing out the sweat off my scalp, but keeping the ends of my hair dry (my hair is about waist length). It seems to work more or less, though it was a bit itchy (maybe I didn't rinse well enough).

The lower sections would kinda feel crunchy or like straw if that makes sense, both when wet and dry.

Anyhow, over the weekend I had some time off, so I though I'd do a full hair treatment. Started off with one week greasy hair (this would be the time I usually wash it).

I first did a milk and honey mask. Melted three teaspoons of honey into a cup or two of full fat milk, soaked my towel dried hair with the mixture focusing on the ends. Let it sit for close on an hour, then rinsed it out with water only.

Had some castor oil laying around, and put some on the most damaged sections of my hair while still damp. Let it sit for a day.

Did a egg yolk mask/wash (as I will do anytime I really need to clean the hair like now due to the oil), and put a small amount of a Lush massage bar (mainly cocoa and shea butter) on the ends as a conditioner.

My hair is the softest and nicest it has been in such a long time! The shine is crazy, and not oily or waxy at all. I think my hair was just dying for some moisture.

Try this if your hair feels a bit dry and unmanageable. I will def incorporate milk and honey masks more frequently.

Sorry for the poor picture qualities :/

edit: If anyone has any comments or advice (like hey castor oil is actually not great for your hair, try x or y instead), I'd love to hear!

I'm getting started on NoPoo. I've recently been pregnant and I have enjoyed the benefits of the pregnancy hormones on my hair. I could avoid shampoos for 6 days.

Hair description:

My hair is brown/reddish, thin, mid-long, and I usually dye it once a month with supermarket dye shampoos to cover some whites. 


Perspective:

I believe this is the ideal moment for me to transition, since I'm going on holiday (no stress about greasy hair in the office) and I'll spend my third transition week at the seaside (potentially a lot of sea water + normal water washes).


Questions:

1. About NoPoo products:

I don't want to use anything but water (and comb/brush). No rye flour, no baking soda, etc. Is this realistic? 


2. About washing or not washing:

I've already started by not washing my hair for 4 days (I usually wash it every other day or max every 3 days). Today it's greasy. Should I wash it with water already or waiting is better? 


3. About hair dye:

Towards the end of week #3 I will have to dye my hair again before I go to the office. Can I still use the supermarket dye? (no henna, it can give you skin cancer and I already have it 😄, thank you) ",NoPoo

My hair always looked greasy at the top and dried out in the lengths. It didn't bother me that much because I usually put it up in a braid. But I also lose much more hair than before.

I wanted to document my no shampoo journey here. I have a mid-length bob, blond hair, kind of wavy and want to let it grow and to have curls 🙈 (my dream 😍). I did the transitioning from conventional shampoo to organic, without sulfate / silicone a few years back but never really attempted a real no shampoo apart from one time in holidays at the sea. 

My hair gets kind of greasy but at the same time it’s dry if I don’t wash it. some other times it’s limp and greasy, depending on hormons I guess. I washed it every 2 or 3 days with shampoo and I have really hard water. It best form is on the sea side were it gets crazy curly and I can stretch out the washing. It doesn’t get too much oily, but lot of volume and a bit dry (because of the sea salt that I just wash out with water).

Now my last wash with shampoo was 3 days ago. Today I washed my hair with one organic egg (yellow + white), I put some essential oils in it and rinced out with lots of water. I finished with AVC. My hair is really soft, bouncy and feels clean. No greasiness !

Ever since I was a teenager whenever I washed my hair, From then on to the second day with just water, it would ALWAYS be waxy as hell.

I even tried no shampoo for a few months with only water and the wax built al the way down to my hair tips and would not go away, apple cider vinegar never did anything.

I ended up using shampoo but avoiding water on my second day since then.
But it was still crap and would be oily within hours of washing and just get worse and not stop.

So recently I’ve been trying to look up better methods for getting rid of oily hair because I started wetting my hair on the second day again and it looks terrible like it always did and is hella waxy at the top of the head.

I’ve only been washing my hair with this https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/325785/organic-care-kids-hair-care-3-in-1-fruit-blast every second day and not touching my hair roots or scalp with anything, because the so-called natural shampoo bars have more dangerous ingredients than normal shampoo, I just don’t touch the roots or scalp, but I got skin flaking off even though I scrub my scalp with water in the shower.

My hair is always crap when I wet it without washing it.

I was wondering if I could brush all purpose flour or other powders or something through my dry hair and not have to wet my hair and it could get rid of the oil or something? I’ve never tried stuff like this before btw. I don’t wanna use exotic hipster ingredients.

This is my first post here and I didn't knew that this community existed in reddit. I heard about no poo when I googled my questions out of curiosity about not using shampoo. 

I have been on it for 40 days. There was dandruff and all in the beginning but everything was fine. 

One problem I had was that my hair gets all tangled up like messy and all if I don't use oil. I usually use coconut hair oil.  Like I can't comb my hair unless I use oil. I wanted to know if this is something I should be concerned about. 

I would love to hear your thoughts on this. ",NoPoo
6619,t3_8t3w5g,"Hi all, I'm 21 year old male hair with medium length, wavy/curly brown hair (not quite at my shoulders).

I tried NoPoo a month ago as I got tired of the following routine: Day 1 - I shampoo and my hair looks frizzy and brittle, Day 2 - it looks nice but slightly greasy Day 3 - looks greasy and need to shampoo 

So I quit shampoo and have been water only since I wanted something completely low maintenance. However, I am now finding that using shampoo was less maintenance than this. My hair constantly feels stuck on my head, it looks bad unless I use dry shampoo. I have to brush it to bring down the oils (never used to brush my hair) but it feels like the oils stay up there. 

I'm close to giving in the towel, as I don't like this feeling. I know there is an awkward stage to get past, but brushing my hair and constantly massaging my hair  is more effort than using shampoo!

Is there something that I could use that is good for wavy hair to keep it ungreasy? I don't really care about the shampoo toxicity stuff, and I'm willing to use it maybe once a week if I have to. Any advice on how to get into a routine for this?",NoPoo
6620,t3_8sy37t,"So as I'm now almost 2 months in NoPoo, I've done my share of experimenting with NoPoo options. Egg yolk wash works the best, but I can't do it every time because of protein build up. After doing some homework, I found that it's the emulsifier aspect of the yolk that washes hair so well : it binds to the excess hair oils and washes right out. So going further down the rabbit hole, I read that soy lecithin is an emulsifier with very little protein. PERFECT. Or so I thought. I started washing my hair with it, scrubbing the granules to my scalp and my hair was nooooot feeling it. In fact, the more I scrubbed, the more it started to dreadlock. For reference, I have medium thickness, straight, shoulder length hair. IT HAS NO BUSINESS DREADLOCKING. It's like the strands started clupming together and they're also sticky??? The best way I could describe it is like if you downed an entire bottle of hair spray in your hair and dumped your head under a faucet for a second - that clumpy, sticky hair feeling. Guys, I don't know how to wash it out. I tried undiluted castille soap and even an anti-residue shampoo I had leftover from my shampoo days. Hardly anything. I cracked two eggs and washed with the egg yolk as well.. all of those things maaaaaybe made it like, 1/5 better. Rubbing alcohol didn't work, and neither did reguar hair oil.

6622,t3_8svwuj,"Hello reddit. I've so far loved my NoPoo experience. I embarked on my 6 month long journey last November, and have kept a simple routine for about 4 months without any interruptions or mishaps. 
I am a dude, and lately I've been sporting a mild, faded undercut with an ever-growing 5 inch top. I don't use any store-bought hair gels, pomades, products etc. A few months back I used to put a little coconut oil in my hair though it left very grotesque and offensive smell within a day or so of applying it. It gave my hair a little more hold though it did not drastically improve anything, so I decided to go with out it. Overall, going NoPoo has given my hair some more hold, meaning that it has been easier to style it and push it up and away from my face without any products. The natural oils and sebum really serve as their own kind of gel or product. However, despite this natural improvement, I'm left wanting something a little better.

I recently went to barbershop for a trim and decided to allow my barber to put a little bit of product in my hair. I must admit, that despite NoPoo making my hair look more natural and healthy, certain products give me a look that I cannot achieve naturally. The barber put some sort of ""tonic"" and fiber gel into my hair, and I really like the way it holds. I don't apply any synthetic products on a daily basis, and I don't think that I ever will, though to see that my hair can look so cool when styled-up with manly (think '60s rockstar) products is certainly refreshing. 
After this ordeal, I decided to wash my hair with a sulfate-containing shampoo for the first time in 4 months (note: I had been strictly water-only during that 4 month period as well), in order to get rid of any build up I had accumulated from the products the barber put in my hair, over time etc. I must admit that it left my hair feeling extremely clean, despite it stripping my hair of its natural oils. However, washing with this shampoo left my hair lifeless and lacking in volume (fell flat on my forehead). The gentlest of winds blew my quiff into a stupid-looking fringe. I decided that I needed to find a natural product that would help me keep my hair off of my face whilst enriching it naturally. I remembered reading about flaxseed hair gels a while back, though I only found it mentioned in strictly curly hair forums, African/frizzy hair oriented forums etc. I wondered if it would work on relatively straight hair, if it could act as a natural styling agent such as more traditional, synthetic hair products for men (flaxseed gel is directed at curly-haired women). I went to the store and bought a bag of flaxseeds, followed a simple recipe I found online, and made my own batch of the gel. I applied it to my hair while damp, and blowdried it for a few minutes. While I found that the hold wasn't as strong as I had hoped, it really does its job well at keeping my hair off of my face. I would consider a light-hold product. Longevity and the nutritional value of this product can be enhanced by adding honey or any of the well known natural oils often discussed on this sub.

*It should be noted that I used this product after washing my hair with sulfate shampoo, thus ridding my hair of it's natural oils. I hope that once my hair returns to equilibrium, which I suspect will happen in about 4-5 days, that the flaxseed gel will work together with my hair's natural oils in order to produce a stronger hold. Thank you for reading and I apologize for the wall of text. 

Verdict: In my experience, flaxseed gel, which is often directed at frizzy or curly haired women, works on shorter and straighter hair, acting as a light-hold product sufficient to keep hair off of one's forehead and or face

This morning they looked alright, oil gives them that wet look tho. I had my friend over for a late lunch and he said nothing about my hair.

* Improved mood, energy, and alertness.
* Muscle weakness gone and improved grip.
* Stopped feeling cold all the time.
* No longer sore/stiff after physical labor, such as mowing lawn.
* No more mucus when spitting.
* Less brittle, more manageable hair.

I had made no other changes.  After about a week, the gains seemed less dramatic, but still there.  Perhaps there was a detox period and things had leveled off, I thought.

Adjust your ratios if you need to. If you have very fine hair, use a lot less conditioner. It will weigh your hair down and make it look greasy if you use too much.

Waxiness and dandruff were inmediatly gone. Instead, i got super clean hair when i got out of the shower, but didnt feel heavy or dry as it used to feel when i used shampoo. Still losing lots of hair tho! :c But now i'm sure that's because of my diet.

Its been a week since i did the egg yolk wash, and no rinses in between. My hair right now starts to feel greasy, but really slightly. Compared to how it got super greasy two days after washing it with shampoo, so its a huge difference!.

6672,t3_8lb4ac,"So I let one of my kombucha cultures grow without tending to it and it gave me a hefty-ass 1 inch thick kombucha SCOBY. Has anyone ever tried blending a kombucha SCOBY and making it a thick smoothie type paste to rub in their hair? I've heard of using the kombucha vinegar as a rinse (obvs being acidic, as a substitute for apple cider vinegar or lemon juice), so my logic is why not the SCOBY itself, right? Maybe even add some essential oils to it / blended herbs and stick it in a glass jar in the fridge and take out as much as needed for a shampooing. 
My only reservation is that it's the bacterial / fungal culture itself instead of the vinegar, so I'm wondering if it will mess up hair's bacterial balance.
Am I going too far down the rabbit hole with this? 

Anyways, will experiment and update. If my hair falls out, well.. now we know. 

OK, UPDATE!:
So I cut off a 2x2 piece of SCOBY and blended it with some filtered water. Thanks to Je4Fy, I had the good sense to cut quarter sized pieces with some scissors instead of putting the whole chunk in there and burning my blender motor. I have a good enough blender that it blended into a thicker applesauce-type texture, which is what I wanted. I added a couple drops of Cedarwood and Rosemary essential oils for flavor, but that's not anything new added to my hair. 

The wash went fairly well. I had about 1/3 of a cup of SCOBY which I scrubbed into my hair and left for about 10 min. I rinsed for 2-3 min. 

Upon checking my hair in the mirror, I saw little flakes that you would see when doing a rye flour wash. By this point my hair was half dry and I didn't want to wet it again, so I figured I'd let it dry and then snow-flurry the flakes out (gross, I know, but whatevs). 

Well, it wasn't as easy to snow-flurry as the SCOBY doesn't get dry like rye flour, it's naturally rubbery so it was a pain to get out. It's the next day and I'm still finding small flakes but I'd say it's 95% out. And I have straight, short hair that's not even that thick! I would nooot recommend it for curly or long hair. My naturally soft oily hair also felt dryer and coarser as it was drying, but normalized once dry. 

In closing, I'm not sure I would do it again. The only positive that I can MAYBE see is that I swear my hair grew a little overnight. But then again, I'm using EO and Biotin to stimulate hair growth, sooo.. the jury's still out on that one. But it also seems coincidental. hmmph. 
Also, my scalp feels slightly tingly/itchy here and there (like if you didn't rinse out your apple cider vinegar well enough), but I don't know if that's just my paranoia that I washed my hair with a living bacterial and fungal paste. 

TL;DR: Yeah.. I honestly don't think I'd try it again. The SCOBY is just too much of a pain to wash out and I didn't care for the coarser texture while it was drying. Anyways, it was worth the experiment!",NoPoo

(My routine: The last time I used shampoo was 2/28/18 and since then I've been washing with diluted Dr. Bronner's followed by a diluted ACV rinse and cool water. 2 days between washes for the month of March, and since 4/1 I've been going for 3 days between washes. My hair is straight, about chin-length, and not particularly fine or coarse.)",NoPoo

6708,t3_8eogod,"I’ve been on and off rogaine for the past 3 years and have found that it is is actually pretty effective for me. 

Currently I’m off it, partly due to problems I’ve had trying to wash out the rogaine residue (I’ve used the foam, haven’t tried the liquid version).

In the past, I’ve ended up shampooing way too much - at least once a day, and ended up with a terribly dry scalp. 

I’ve been trying out the nopoo life for a couple weeks now, and my hair feels great. I’m tempted to get back on the rogaine to slow down the balding process, but I’m worried I’ll just fall back into the same old cycle of dry scalp problems.

My home water is extremely hard, you can even smell the chlorine in it when you run the shower. So I tried a chelating shampoo (kenra clarifying), thinking maybe my issues were caused by buildup. 

Well, that was last night, and today my scalp is very flaky and all the acnes look pretty much the same, possibly, slightly worse.

6720,t3_8c4nzr,"My best friend has been trying to get me to go no-poo for years now. It has never worked for me. Until now.

About my hair: Naturally dirty blonde, about 20-30% gray, frequently highlighted (as in every 6 weeks-two months; very fine hair, but not necessarily thin, has a lot of volume when blown dry straight; waves/ curls a bit (2b-c depending on length) yet without any rhyme or reason.  Hair currently is about an inch or two below my chin (i.e., not quite long enough to put into a neat sleek pony tail). I haven't worn my hair this long in ages because it typically breaks off before it gets past my shoulders, and just looks ratty. And when it's that long and I put it in a hairband, it's just so fine, well, we call it ""the nubbin."" And I have to tie the hairband so tight since it'll just slip off, it results in breakage. My hair prefers the dreaded clippy, but this is 2018. :-(

My ends typically always look dry and destroyed. But oils just don't work either. Over the years I've tried it all - jojoba, morrocan, coconut oil, olive oil.. before, during after shower, and overnight with a cap on. It just sits on my hair making it look like a super shiny grease pit, and doesn't seem to absorb. Though does soften my hair -- once I shampoo it out.

Also - a big ALSO - I have had scalp psoriasis since I was a child. It can get really bad, as in covering my entire scalp. This isn't dandruff either. Big flakes, lots of itch. Prescription shampoo (Clobetasal) works great to control it, but if I've run out then I am abusing my hair with all kinds of harsh tar shampoos. 

I am really careful to avoid chlorine or salt water or too much sun, as all of that can result in straw hair for me. Yet my hair plumps up and/or frizzes in high humidity. Which sometimes can make it look great, I just can't predict. 

Best friend aforementioned has gorgeous thick straight long hair, which she washes only once a week, and looks perfect regardless of the weather. She insists it's as fine and thick as mine, but I just don't see it.

So I have tried this no-poo thing numerous times over the years, yearning for same healthy head of hair, with zero success. Even if I could endure the grease of day 2 / 3 hair, I couldn't endure the psoriasis flare up which was unbearable. 

Then I got a new hairdresser who recommended a new shampoo and conditioner, which is sulfate, paraben, and silicone free. I have been using it daily for 6 months.  Alternating with the prescription shampoo every now and then... and then less and less. Because my scalp has totally cleared up! It's never felt better!!!!

Two weeks ago I decided to give no-poo one last try. My girlfriend is visiting me at the end of this month so I figured I could maybe try until then. 

Week one I was able to go 6 days without washing!!!!! I am amazed. I've never been able to go that long. (Note I did one last wash with the Rx shampoo, no conditioner. Then I did a WO wash a few times the first week, and co-washed when needed for de-tangling. Then on the last day tried curly girl method -- using olive oil-- and it was a disaster so I shampooed). 

This week, I am on day 6 again and I think I can push it at least one more day, as I invested in a BBB brush which does seem to be helping. I still seemed to need to WO wash it twice this week, and I put on just a little (like a teaspoon) worth of conditioner on the ends to de-tangle in the shower with a wide-tooth comb. 

I'd love to let my natural waves go free, but I'm finding that my hair seems to want to be blown dry straight. I am thinking that the heat of the blow dryer helps the sebum penetrate the shaft or something? It definitely looks and feels the best when I blow dry it straight after a WO wash.

I'll add here that in the past I did try dry shampoos, but they left me unbearably itchy on the scalp, so much so, I had to hop in the shower. I'll also add that I am very hesitant to try BS or ACV, as I am reading mix reviews about their effects.

I've been trying out the no poo method for well over a month now, and I'm still having problems. My hair is straight and very fine, at collarbone length, half grown out natural and half damaged from bleach thanks to a mishap a couple years ago with a stylist. The worst of it has been cut off long ago but compared to my natural virgin hair it's an entirely different type of hair altogether. 

I don't shower often because of my eczema anyway, so I have already been keeping my hair washing to a minimum before I started going no poo, but I still can't find a balance. Every time I go through all the effort of BBB, masks, baking soda, vinegar, etc, my hair will ALWAYS come out after a shower being overly oily on my roots and dry as heck on the damaged parts and the ends. It's driving me up the wall. I already have naturally blonde hair so too much oil always stands out no matter what I do. As a result I end up having to put cornstarch into my freshly washed hair and I am starting to feel skeptical about people who talk about healthy shiny hair when mine has to end up being a matte mess all the time. 

I try honey, and my hair gets dry. I try oils, and I can't get them out unless I use egg which often I don't have the time for at that point. It's a nightmare. 
Currently I've had a honey and kefir mask on overnight, showered normally today and my ends are so dry they are crunchy, but still somehow oily roots despite doing baking soda and vinegar in the shower. 

For extra info: I have hard water, but I did get a shower filter. It's not a full water softener but its the best I can do. I also can't find any ACV where I am (Poland), so I've been using diluted white vinegar. I also dilute my baking soda quite a bit (about 1/5 to water). 

What am I missing here? Should I revert to using shampoo and conditioner until my damaged hair grows out completely?

6753,t3_85prnu,"**Background**

&amp;nbsp;

Ever since I've taken finding the right look and haircut for myself seriously, I've realized that every time I used shampoo, my hair would puff up and become frizzy after drying. I'm currently growing out my hair to go for a ""short on sides, long on top"" kind of haircut for my curly hair.

Something like this: https://i.imgur.com/bRQ1jNp.jpg

Right now I'm combing my hair flat to the side to avoid looking like an overgrown bush while I await my next haircut appointment.
I have thick, black, wavy hair (the degree of which is undetermined as I have not yet grown it long enough) with low porosity.

&amp;nbsp;

**Approach**

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I grabbed the bull by the horn and started off doing water only once a week on Fridays and am pleasantly surprised with the results. I have been sporadically following the scritching, preening, boar-bristle brushing (SPB) routine every 1-4 days, depending on how my scalp and hair feel from justprimalthings.com albeit not having a boar bristle brush, which I substituted by gripping bundles of hair with my fingers and running through their length in different patterns.

&amp;nbsp;

**Week 1**

* Hair feels much oilier, though not as bad as I've read through other posts. Hands feel quite oily after running hands through hair.
* Hair feels really solid, crusty, and clumpy after taking a shower, taking on a straw-like consistency and texture.
* Hair dried really quick and I had itchy / dry scalp later in the day, and next few days.

&amp;nbsp;

**Observations:**

I believe I my hair had a straw-like texture because I had just begun this schedule after using shampoo, I also used hot water when showering because I thought I would be A-OK as long as I did not use shampoo, however week 2 proved that wrong. I finished my shower with cold water (knob turned all the way). This is also the week when I used a lot of coconut oil on my ends to reverse the damage from using my old hair products.

&amp;nbsp;

**Week 2**

* Hair feels less oily, I feel like my oils have distributed themselves more evenly throughout my hair
* Hair feels softer, heavier, silkier, w/ more structural integrity and less frizz. This is more true in the front of my head rather than the back, which still somewhat has a straw-like texture. Perhaps I need to moisturize that area?
* No longer feels like straw and retains moisture for a really long time after combing and flattening it, and it stayed moist after drying.

&amp;nbsp;

**Observations:**

This time when showering, I used warm water instead of hot water. I think this helped to retain the natural oils from my hair and allow them to keep their ability to stay moisturized even after drying, since hot water strips too much oils and dries out my hair.

Another thing I've noticed is that when I use cold water to wash, it feels like there is a lot of friction going on between my fingers and my hair, however when I use warmer water the hair feels much softer when washing and less friction goes on. I definitely would have considered washing with cold water if it didn't feel like I was pulling my hair all the time. Can someone explain this? Rinsed with cold water to cool down hair and close up hairs sheaths and pores.

&amp;nbsp;

**Pictures**

Before: https://imgur.com/a/Kv4um

After: https://imgur.com/a/Bk7sv

&amp;nbsp;

The pictures were taken at night, and my hair is completely dry in all of the photos. Its appearance today has deviated very little from the shape that I combed it into after my morning shower, and what astonishes me is the difference in how easily I can style my hair, how moisturized it feels, the difference in frizz, and how it keeps its shape. If you look at the last image with the top view of my head, you'll notice that the pattern of the hair at the front looks different than the pattern from the back. Compared to the front, the back is clumpier, frizzier, and drier, reminiscent of the old appearance of my hair - though not as much as when I first started.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion / TL;DR**

&amp;nbsp;

All in all, my hair has reduced in frizziness, has become much easier to sculpt, retains moisture better, feels softer, dries quicker, and is less oily on non-wash days. This is evident in the change of appearance of my frontal hair, although not as pronounced in the back parts of my scalp for some reason. Perhaps it needs time to catch up.

I haven't been pregnant or anything else I can think of that would have had an impact on my hormones. Literally the only changes I've made between now and two years ago is my diet. 

I didn't even eat a lot of meat in the first place either. I did eat a lot of processed food though. I could have guessed that quitting meat would result in somewhat less grease being produced but the difference is astounding to me. And it's only been a few days so I expect it to just get better as time goes on. I'd say probably half the hair is pulled out when I brush after showering and my head has stopped being itchy (I decided to quit shampoo again cause I was starting to get hives, yikes).

I just wanted to share that with you guys. Especially if you're already considering a lifestyle change, this is just one more reason to do it. I'm already feeling physically better than I have in my life too. It was a hard change to make but so worth it, and now I'm just waiting till my hair starts looking fuller and nicer too :D",NoPoo

6759,t3_852sc4,"I've been creeping on this forum but officially I'm brand new to reddit and I've joined now in desperate search for some WO help.
I feel like I've been doing EVERYTHING right but the last week and a half I've got a terrible waxy build-up and dandruff. This is gonna be a long one, I'm sorry...

I've been doing WO for a month, but have been no-poo for about a year and a half using shampoo bars and ACV. My hair is long and wavy/curly, not quite thin, but definitely not thick. So here's my routine:
The first couple of weeks of WO my hair got greasy obviously, but I was **scritching, preening and using my BBB** with good effect. I've been scritching and preening when washing as well, first with **hot water, then cold**. My hair's been a little greasy, but I've been able to wear it down for a day or so without looking too gross. I squeeze most water out of my hair and then put it up in a **t-shirt** for a couple of minutes only, and apply **jojoba oil** to the ends. I detangle with a wide toothed comb. I use my BBB every other night before bed, and I sleep on a **silk pillowcase** that I rinse every other day if I'm too lazy to do a proper wash. I sometimes BBB in the morning if my hair is very greasy. I've been **washing every two or three days**. I know for sure I have **soft water** so that shouldn't be a problem. The last week I also tried washing with **only cold water**, but it just didn't dissolve anything properly and hair looked the same as when I got in the shower.

I had little specks of dandruff in varying amounts when I was nopoo, but nothing like this. This feels as if I've used a no poo bar with no ACV rinse in hard water for the first time ever... It's difficult to preen even because it's so waxy. My brush is also covered in white dust after having thoroughly cleaned it and used it just one time. What the fork is up with my hairs!? I really really want so bad to be WO and it's so frustrating when I feel like I've been doing everything right, I was on the right track and now I'm just confused and have bad hair..

**TLDR; Please read the bolds anyway I'm sorry this is so long!!!**

But with the oncoming hot weather I sweat and notice my hair getting oilier and less voluminous. Should i do something else to solve the oily issue now that it's going to get hotter where I live? 
The only thing I've done thus far is water wash every other day and scrub scalp and my hair has been fine. ",NoPoo
6781,t3_813leg,"I've been doing No-Poo for about two months, and I want to share some things I've noticed/potential benefits, for all the struggling people out there.

A bit of background first: my hair is about shoulder-length, mostly straight, not very dense, extremely low-porosity, and has leftover highlights. I've had various scalp issues, and my hair has always gotten really oily really fast, and so I've tried various methods, but I never washed it more than once every 5 days because it was too much of a hassle. Before really starting no-poo I had been unknowingly using a silicone-free shampoo, and I had also been dilluting it, so my transition period was definitely not as bad as it could've been.
So here are some changes I've noticed:

**Hair never feels gross** - No matter what conventional shampoo I used, my hair would always get really greasy at the crown on day 3, and it would kind of clump together, so much so that I could barely run my hands through it. Now, while it never feels as 'clean' as it used to with conventional shampoo, even after 7 days of not washing it doesn't feel half as gross as it used to after 3 days. I could go a lot longer and it would be fine, but I choose not to because for once in my life I actually enjoy washing it.

**Never feels dried out** - With conventional shampoo, it always felt like I had two different hair textures: the crown always oily and clumped together, but the roots always dry and brittle. Whereas now its texture in general feels different, more uniform, with the highlights only a tiny bit drier than the rest, but not enough to be a problem. Also I never get tangles anymore.

**More volume** - Conventional shampoo always made it frizzy, unnaturally puffy, and really hard to manage. Now it has more volume, it never looks limp, no matter what I use on it, and the individual strands feel a lot stronger.

**Grows faster** - I never really wanted to grow it out, but there was always a point when it kind of just... stopped growing, even if I trimmed it regularly. But now it grows incredibly fast, probably because of all the brushing and massaging I've been doing. 

**Less scalp problems** - I'm pretty sure I have seb-derm, but on top of that I would often get random bursts of dandruff, and I didn't know what to do about it, apart from buying anti-dandruff shampoo, which didn't do anything. There might not be much I can do against the seb-derm, but at least now the rest of my scalp never feels dry, flaky, or itchy as it used to, so I'm satisfied.

**No more hair-loss** - I had a period of time when for whatever reason I lost so much hair on a daily basis, it was really bothersome, but I didn't know the cause. Now I brush it a lot more often than I used to, but even then, and even when I wash it, I don't think I lose a third the amount that I used to.

**Dries slower** - I don't know how much of a good thing this is, but it definitely doesn't start drying as soon as I get out of the shower as it used to. I had a few weeks when it didn't feel dry even after half a day, but now it takes about 4-5 hours at most. Might be my hair freaking out, or the cold weather. I'm not too bothered.

For reference, I started No-Poo by using stuff like honey, tea, rye flour, etc. for a few weeks, and deep-conditioning often. I haven't yet found a method that works perfectly long-term, but I've been experimenting with shampoo bars, and at least I've found some natural things my hair likes (mostly acidic stuff. Fermented rice water works wonders). If I find a shampoo bar I like, I might stick with that for a while, but my long-term goal is to go water-only, if possible.

What worked for me might not work for you, but if you're struggling, I would strongly suggest not to give up, just try different things, and most of all, listen to your hair. You'll get there one day. ",NoPoo

Recently found this sub and figured it would be a great start in getting some tips in becoming NoPoo!

Back when I was in school I had started NoPoo, maybe washed my hair once a week with shampoo. At some point I started using goats milk soap(in attempt to reduce my plastic consumption) to wash my hair but soon my hair turned out a little waxy and felt weird and heavy (after reading in this sub I found out maybe washing with cold water would change this, but havent attempted yet).

However, I've recently started a new job where I want to look good so I don't want to put my hair up...

Because of that, i decided to try the baking soda and chamomile tea method of cleansing (i didn't had any acv in hand) just to get rid of the oil. My goal was to be water only if it was possible.
I did the recommended 1 tbsp per cup. And the baking soda felt very slippery, until i rinsed it off and it felt kind of hard? Now my hair feels harder and even greasier. Yet i noticed when i brush, it left like a white residue on the bristles. And upon close inspection, my hair has tiny white dots too ): 

I do have dandruff however since i started the nopoo it seems  to have calmed a bit. I read the sidebar and thought this may be because of the water. Maybe it's just too hard for me to be water only. So i have a couple questions:

1.- should i go back to shampoo?
2.- or are there methods of nopoo that won't react with my hard water?

6802,t3_7xl9d8,"Hey all

So I’ve been trying to go fully no poo for about 6 months, but I never really managed to go past 1-2 weeks without washing my hair with a sulfate free shampoo. My hair would get stringy and unmanageable, my head would get itchy, and I’d get cystic pimples all over my scalp that would make the hair fall out

I tried different methods; boar bristle brushes, lemon washes, ACV washes, leaving it as long as I could. The best method I ever came across was mixing about a teaspoon of Tea Tree oil with 1-2 tablespoons of water, and lathering that in my hair. Helped a lil with the itchiness and made my hair a bit softer, but never completely helped. My hair would still get gross and oily and itchy a few days later.

Enter aloe vera. 
At my parents house we have heaps of massive Aloe plants, which I frequently use on my skin. 
I mixed about a tablespoon of aloe with 2 tablespoons of water, and a few drops of rosemary oil and tea tree oil. 
How much aloe you use should depend on your hair (I have fine, mid-back length hair, closest to hair type 2A) as you want to try and completely cover at least your scalp
I left the aloe mix in my hair for 3 hours before rinsing it out in the shower, not following up with any shampoo or conditioner

It’s been nearly a week and my hair isn’t even slightly oily. It’s so soft and manageable; it’s never been this nice! 
Aloe vera has the same PH balance as our hair (6), so I believe it perfectly conditions it. Unlike other methods, like ACV and lemon which are slightly more acidic than our hair, the aloe balances our hair so the scalp doesn’t need to produce more oils! 

TLDR: Mix 1 tablespoon aloe with 1-2 tablespoons water, and a few drops of an oil of your choice for the nicest, most amazing hair of your life!

1. Near the end of the week it gets super dandruff-y and itchy. I've never had dandruff so do I need to wash more often? Or will it adjust? I'm trying to was less because it feels so nice and soft towards the end of the week and I lose that when I wash it.

2. I've only washed with this shampoo bar twice, but both times it's left residue that makes my hair really hard to brush when it's dry, and my brush turns white. I have soft water here, so it's not that. Is this a normal thing?",NoPoo
6806,t3_7xisks,"I decide to start NoPoo only water method. Do you prefer warm or cold water. Does it have to be everyday or 2 or 3 days. Please give me some tips.

I thought of doing ginger apple sprays and Arm &amp; Hammer, but I felt it would only make hair weaker/damage from one the spray solutions.",NoPoo
6807,t3_7xhk1n,"I'm a male. Trying to grow long hair. I don't really know or remember when i entered the awkward stage, but i think i am still in it, as i dont find my hair flattering. They just dont fall down the way i want them. The only thing right now that makes me feel somewhat attractive is a bun. And with my lenght its not a twist bun but a fold bun.
I noticed that when I wash my hair with shampo (and conditioner) my hair gets very puffy when it dries. Doesn't matter if I let it dry naturally or if i blowdry, when it dries it just gets super puffy which makes it unmanageable. It just settles into a middlepart which to me (at least at this lenght) looks awful and if i try to flip it to one one side it just falls back and wiggles around. If i try to make bun (probably cuz of my lenght) the front hair just escapes the rubber band, meaning i have to tie it up all over again every now and then. It doesn't have any grip. But when a day or sometimes two days go since shamooping its much easier to manage. Easier to flip it over to one side and make it stay like that, and much easier to make a bun.
I read that sulphates makes your hair puffy. So i bought sulphate free shampoo and for now i washed my hair three timss with it. Its still puffy afterwards but much less than with regular shampoo with sulphates. And a bit easier to manage on the first day.

Now I'm here asking: if i go nopoo will my hair always look and feel like the second day hair and be easier to manage? (i dont really mind if i have to water wash it every day, just so it doesnt look puffy). 

And also I saw on youtube a girl talking about nopoo and she was not satisfied. She said it made her hair gummy, and when she started using shampoo again her hair stayed gummy. I dont think i want that. So how often does it happen that someone gets gummy hair? Does it depend on hair type and skint type or did that girl do something wrong?

And also i think i have quite greasy hair. On day three or four i already have to wash it cuz i look gross and actually feels gummy like the youtuber girl said. So could that potentially be a problem?
Other than oily, grease hair, i never had much problems with my scalp (no itchiness; never had much or actually any dandruff at all, even when i had shorter hair and used styling products, although with short hair i did wash it with water only and every day, but thats short hair now i am growing it long and its already quite long).

I hope I gave all the informations you nopoo masters need to help me figure out the best hair routine for my hair. Thank guys. ",NoPoo
6808,t3_7xia85,"so i am doing nopoo for like two months and my dandruff problem i had really improved - but it is not gone. i wash my head with water every morning and after shower i can always see some tiny dandruffs across my hair - not many, but still. what am i doing wrong?",NoPoo
6809,t3_7xcbzz,"So I've been using shampoo bars for the last half year, usually washing my hair every 3-4 days. In the last 2 weeks I've only washed it twice and today I decided to try WO again.

6812,t3_7x5qml,"Hey guys. I'm a man with long hair and i started NoPoo around two weeks ago, and im going the water only route. I AM aware that there's a transition period for the hair to get used to not being exposed to shampoo but....how long does it usually take? My hair feels really greasy almost all the time and its driving me nuts XD Its starting to feel a biiiiit better 

Second question and the one that worries me the most: Is it normal that i lose a lot, like, really: A LOT of hair in the transition period? I mean, of course there are other factors for hair loss, and tbh my diet hasnt been the best for a while and lately i've been sleeping less due to some late night work (I'm in progress of changing those habits) so, as expected, i've been suffering some hair loss. However during this last two weeks it has gotten much worse, so idk if it has something to do with the hair being really greasy and such. Any help will be apreciated, thanks :3

EDIT: Also, i've noticed that i have considerable dandruff as well…:B What can i do about that? Cheers :D",NoPoo

6819,t3_7wtwio,"I quit washing my hair about 10 months ago. I did this because I heard it improves texture, waves, and overall quality and health.

My hair looks much better, I **don't think** it smells, it styles easier, isn't greasy but is a little dirty feeling. 

I haven't done anything to my hair but wash with water in the shower since I quit washing. I have very straight, very thick hair, and so I wanted a bit more natural waves and texture which is why I started no poo.

Is there anything I need to be doing long term? I don't want to start using shampoo again because my hair looks and behaves better like this but am I missing any important care of hygiene protocols? ",NoPoo
6820,t3_7wsf1z,"Hey you all!
I have a situation: I'm 19 years old and have been going no poo for over two years now. The result is rather great, my hair has more volume, doesn't get greasy that quickly and I just love my curly hair.
I started going no poo because of my ex, who read it online somewhere and I wanted to support her. 

Now the problem is that neither my family nor my friends get why I do it, as if they don't see an improvement. They call it filthy and dirty. And my older sister is the worst, every time she visits, she tells me to wash it properly with shampoo and that I have to stop being dirty. But I never know what to say to her, how to convince her that it is not dirty and good for my looks...

What are your guys and girls arguments? Do your loved ones know and how do they react? How do I convince them? 

As an aside note: people who don't know I'm doing it, compliment my hair almost weekly, some people even smell it, saying it smells great...

TL;DR: I need arguments why I go no poo... ",NoPoo
6821,t3_7wgpo6,"Hi everyone! New here and have a question after reading a bit here and there about WO.

It's been only a week since the last shampoo and my hairs are not that bad. A bit oily at the roots but nothing disgusting (I mostly keep my hairs in a bun with just a towel drying). The ends are dry but I want to see where it goes on a longer run. I saw that I'm suppose to use cold water to keep the sebum from going away and produce more and to close the pores. But, I just can't use cold water, even just for a minute. My brain won't allow it and I will probably be grumpy all day long. I know it is a caprice but you know, we all have some. So, will it just not work because of that or hot water is ok too? Thank you in advance!!!",NoPoo
