Now I've just inserted a glycerin suppository 30 minutes ago but I'm not really feeling anything at all.\\n\\nI have a check-in with the GI doctor on Monday since he doesn't work weekends. Should I try and see an urgent care doctor before then? Is there something else I should try?   \n",
              "2  I'm curious as to what I should do. I haven't been able to go for 2 days but when I go theres always a lot and I go to the bathroom daily. For me to go 1 day without I'd worrisome. Then, the discomfort set in. Now, I'm in bed and my leg is shaking trying to hold in the waste because it hurts much to bad to go. I know I need to drink more water and Im pretty sure the cause was what I had to eat. It hurts so bad and I've shamefully taken more pills than I should have. 2 different types of laxative and a stool softener. It still hurts too bad but for there to be as much as I suspect, I could use some form of immediate release. Any help is much appreciated and the sooner, the better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

              "4  About a week and a half ago I started feeling constipated, I would usually be able to go #2, but it would be very little stool and I still felt constipated. Last night I drank milk of magnesia thinking this and it worked. However the feeling of being back up is still there. Is it possible to still be constipated after taking a laxative that seems to have done it's job?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

I saw that I'm suppose to use cold water to keep the sebum from going away and produce more and to close the pores. But, I just can't use cold water, even just for a minute. My brain won't allow it and I will probably be grumpy all day long. I know it is a caprice but you know, we all have some. So, will it just not work because of that or hot water is ok too? Thank you in advance!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
